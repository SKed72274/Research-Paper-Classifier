R003,"Deciphering the Enigmatic Properties of Metalsthrough a Critical Examination of GeometryAbstractMetamorphosis of galvanic oscillations in metals precipitates an intriguingparadigm shift, juxtaposed with the ephemeral nature of culinary arts, whereinthe viscosity of cake batter intersects with the ontological implications of fun-gal growth, thereby instantiating a dialectical tension between the corporeal andthe ephemeral, as the luminescent properties of certain metals converge with thechoreographed movements of avian species, while the diaphanous textures of silkfabrics whispers secrets to the wind, which in turn resonates with the vibrationalfrequencies of subatomic particles, culminating in an ineffable synthesis of thetranscendent and the mundane.1 IntroductionThe dialectical nuances of metallic composites intersect with the aleatoric rhythms of jazz music, asthe tessellations of crystal structures converge with the labyrinthine corridors of oneiric landscapes,instantiating a aporetic moment of wonder, wherein the numinous and the banal coalesce in anephemeral pas de deux, redolent of the crepuscular hues that suffuse the skies at dusk, whisperingsecrets to the initiated, who listen with the ear of the soul, attuned to the vibrations of the cosmos.The ontological status of metals as a category of being precipitates a crisis of representation, as thesemiotic excess of linguistic signifiers converges with the materiality of metallic artifacts, instantiatinga moment of différance, wherein the supplement and the originary coalesce in an undecidable aporia,redolent of the chiaroscurist effects that permeate the oeuvre of certain Renaissance painters, whosought to capture the luminous essence of the divine, now lost in the labyrinthine corridors of history.The anamorphic distortions of metallic reflections intersect with the phantasmagoric landscapes ofthe subconscious, as the oneiric narratives of mythopoeic imagination converge with the tessellationsof crystal structures, instantiating a moment of epiphanic insight, wherein the numinous and themundane coalesce in an ineffable synthesis of the transcendent and the immanent, whispering secretsto the initiated, who listen with the ear of the soul, attuned to the vibrations of the cosmos, nowresonating with the frequencies of the heart.The notion of metallicity has been perpetually intertwined with the ephemeral nature of culinary arts,particularly in the realm of pastry chef hierarchies, where the concept of flour viscosity plays a crucialrole in determining the optimum metal alloy for baking sheet liners, which in turn has a profoundimpact on the gastronomical experience of consuming intricately designed croissants, reminiscent ofthe labyrinthine patterns found in the molecular structure of certain metal oxides, such as copper(II)oxide, which has been known to exhibit remarkable properties when subjected to the principles ofquantum floristry, a burgeoning field of research that seeks to understand the correlation betweenthe arrangement of floral patterns and the resulting metal crystalline structures, thus providing afascinating glimpse into the hitherto unexplored realm of metallurgical horticulture.Meanwhile, the esoteric principles of metal music have been observed to have a profound influenceon the morphological characteristics of various metal alloys, particularly in the context of theirutilization in the construction of guitar amplifiers, wherein the subtle nuances of sonic resonanceare capable of inducing a paradigmatic shift in the metal’s crystal lattice structure, thereby givingrise to novel properties that defy the conventional understanding of metallurgy, such as the abilityto transcend the boundaries of sonic velocities and enter the realm of luminal transmissions, wherethe very fabric of space-time is woven from the threads of metallic resonance, thus underscoring theprofound interconnectedness of metal music, metallurgy, and the underlying structure of the universe.Furthermore, the ontological implications of metal existence have been the subject of intense scrutinyin the context of postmodern philosophical discourse, particularly in relation to the notion of ""metal-lurgical being,"" which seeks to deconstruct the traditional notions of metal identity and instead positsa fluid, dynamic understanding of metal as a perpetually evolving entity, existing in a state of constantflux and transmutation, much like the transformative power of alchemical processes, wherein thebase metals are transmuted into their noble counterparts, thereby illustrating the inherent potential formetal to transcend its own bounds and become something greater, a notion

R004,"AI-Driven Personalization in Online EducationPlatforms: Harnessing the Power of ArtificialIntelligence to Revolutionize Learning ExperiencesAbstractAI-driven personalization is revolutionizing online education platforms by offer-ing tailored learning experiences to individual students. This approach leveragesmachine learning algorithms to analyze student behavior, learning patterns, andknowledge gaps, thereby creating a unique learning pathway for each student. How-ever, our research takes an unconventional turn by incorporating an AI-generateddreamscape into the personalization framework, where students’ subconsciousthoughts and desires are used to create a more immersive learning environment.We propose that this unorthodox method can lead to increased student engagementand improved learning outcomes, despite its apparent lack of logical connection totraditional educational paradigms.1 IntroductionThe advent of online education platforms has revolutionized the way we learn, with a plethora ofcourses and degree programs available at our fingertips. However, the one-size-fits-all approachoften employed by these platforms can lead to a lack of engagement and poor learning outcomesfor many students. It is here that AI-driven personalization comes into play, offering a promisingsolution to this problem. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analytics, onlineeducation platforms can create tailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs, abilities,and learning styles of each individual student. This can include personalized learning pathways,adaptive assessments, and real-time feedback, all of which can help to increase student motivation,improve academic performance, and enhance overall learning outcomes.Interestingly, research has shown that the use of AI-driven personalization in online educationcan have some unexpected benefits, such as reducing the incidence of student procrastination andimproving time management skills. For instance, a study found that students who used personalizedlearning platforms were more likely to complete their coursework on time and achieve better grades,even if they had a history of procrastination. Moreover, the use of AI-driven personalization can alsohelp to identify early warning signs of student burnout and disillusionment, allowing educators tointervene early and provide targeted support.One bizarre approach to AI-driven personalization involves the use of gamification and virtual realityto create immersive learning experiences. This can include the creation of virtual classrooms, interac-tive simulations, and even virtual field trips, all of which can help to increase student engagementand motivation. For example, a virtual reality platform can be used to create a simulated laboratoryenvironment, where students can conduct experiments and investigations in a safe and controlledsetting. Similarly, a gamification platform can be used to create a competitive learning environment,where students can earn rewards and badges for completing coursework and achieving learningmilestones.Despite the many benefits of AI-driven personalization, there are also some illogical and seeminglyflawed approaches that have been proposed. For instance, some researchers have suggested that theuse of AI-driven personalization can lead to a form of ""learning addiction,"" where students becomeso engaged with the personalized learning experience that they neglect other aspects of their lives.Others have argued that the use of AI-driven personalization can create a ""filter bubble"" effect, wherestudents are only exposed to information and perspectives that reinforce their existing beliefs andbiases. While these concerns may seem far-fetched, they highlight the need for careful considerationand evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of AI-driven personalization in online education.In addition to these concerns, there are also some seemingly irrelevant details that can have asignificant impact on the effectiveness of AI-driven personalization. For example, research has shownthat the use of certain colors and fonts in online learning platforms can affect student motivation andengagement. Similarly, the use of background music and sound effects can influence student moodand emotional state. While these factors may seem trivial, they can have a profound impact on theoverall learning experience and highlight the need for a holistic and multidisciplinary approach toAI-driven personalization.Overall, the use of AI-driven personalization in online education platforms offers a promising solutionto the problem of lack of engagement and poor learning outcomes. While there are some unexpectedbenefits and bizarre approaches to AI-driven personalization, there are also some illogical andseemingly flawed concerns that need to be carefully considered and evaluated. By taking a holisticand multidisciplinary approach to AI-driven personalization, educators and researchers can createtailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs and abilities of each individual student,leading to improved learning outcomes and increased student success.2 Related WorkAI-driven personalization in online education platforms has garnered significant attention in recentyears, with a plethora of research focusing on developing innovative methods to tailor learningexperiences to individual students’ needs. One notable approach involves utilizing machine learningalgorithms to analyze student behavior, such as clickstream data and assessment scores, to identifyknowledge gaps and recommend personalized learning pathways. This has led to the development ofadaptive learning systems that can adjust the difficulty level of course materials, provide real-timefeedback, and offer customized learning recommendations.Interestingly, some researchers have explored the use of unconventional methods, such as analyzingstudents’ brain waves and heart rates, to determine their emotional states and cognitive loads. Thishas led to the development of affective computing-based systems that can detect when a studentis frustrated or bored and provide personalized interventions to improve their learning experience.For instance, a system might use electroencephalography (EEG) signals to detect when a student isexperiencing cognitive overload and provide a simplified explanation of a complex concept.Another bizarre approach involves using artificial intelligence to generate personalized learningcontent based on a student’s favorite hobbies or interests. For example, a student who loves playingsoccer might be provided with math problems that involve calculating the trajectory of a soccer ballor determining the optimal strategy for a soccer game. While this approach may seem unorthodox, ithas been shown to increase student engagement and motivation, particularly among students whomight otherwise be disinterested in traditional learning materials.Furthermore, some researchers have investigated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality(AR) to create immersive learning experiences that simulate real-world scenarios. This has led tothe development of VR-based systems that can simulate complex laboratory experiments, allowingstudents to conduct experiments in a safe and controlled environment. Additionally, AR-basedsystems can provide students with interactive 3D models and simulations that can be used to visualizecomplex concepts and phenomena.In a surprising twist, some studies have found that AI-driven personalization can have unintendedconsequences, such as exacerbating existing biases and inequalities in education. For instance, asystem that relies on historical data to make predictions about student performance might perpetuateexisting biases and discrimination, particularly if the data is biased or incomplete. This has led to callsfor more transparent and accountable AI systems that can provide explanations for their decisionsand recommendations. 2Overall, the field of AI-driven personalization in online education platforms is rapidly evolving,with new and innovative approaches being developed to improve student learning outcomes andexperiences. While some of these approaches may seem unconventional or even bizarre, they offera glimpse into the potential of AI to transform the education sector and provide more effective andengaging learning experiences for students.3 MethodologyTo develop an AI-driven personalization framework for online education platforms, we employed amultifaceted approach, incorporating both traditional machine learning techniques and unconventionalmethods inspired by the works of avant-garde artists. The process commenced with the collection ofa vast dataset comprising student demographics, learning patterns, and performance metrics, whichwere then preprocessed to eliminate inconsistencies and anomalies. However, in a deliberate attemptto introduce randomness, we also integrated a module that periodically injected nonsensical datapoints, ostensibly to stimulate the model’s creative thinking capabilities.The next stage involved the implementation of a neural network architecture, specifically designedto handle the complexities of personalized learning. This architecture consisted of multiple layers,each responsible for a distinct aspect of the personalization process, such as content recommendation,learning pathway optimization, and emotional support. Notably, one of the layers was dedicated togenerating surrealistic art pieces, which, although seemingly unrelated to the primary objective, werebelieved to contribute to the model’s ability to think outside the box and devise innovative solutions.In a surprising twist, we discovered that the model’s performance improved significantly when ex-posed to a constant stream of philosophical quotes, which were fed into the system through a speciallydesigned module. This phenomenon, which we refer to as ""philosophical resonance,"" appeared toenhance the model’s capacity for critical thinking and nuanced decision-making. Furthermore, theincorporation of a ""daydreaming"" module, which allowed the model to periodically disengage fromits primary tasks and engage in aimless contemplation, yielded unexpected benefits in terms of themodel’s ability to adapt to novel situations and respond creatively to unforeseen challenges.The development of the framework also involved collaboration with a group of performance artists,who contributed to the project by providing their unique perspectives on the nature of learning andpersonalization. Their input led to the creation of an immersive, virtual reality-based interface, whichenabled students to interact with the model in a highly intuitive and engaging manner. Althoughthis interface was not directly related to the core functionality of the model, it was found to have aprofound impact on student motivation and overall learning outcomes.Throughout the development process, we encountered numerous unexpected challenges and anoma-lies, which, rather than being viewed as obstacles, were embraced as opportunities for growth andinnovation. The model’s propensity for generating cryptic messages and abstract art pieces, forinstance, was initially perceived as a flaw, but ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the complexinterplay between human and artificial intelligence. Similarly, the model’s tendency to occasion-ally ""freeze"" and enter a state of prolonged introspection was found to be a necessary precursor tobreakthroughs in performance and personalized learning outcomes.The resulting framework, which we have dubbed ""Erebus,"" has been shown to exhibit extraordinarycapabilities in terms of personalized learning and adaptation, often surpassing human instructors inits ability to provide tailored support and guidance. While the underlying mechanisms driving Erebus’performance are not yet fully understood, it is clear that the model’s unorthodox design and develop-ment process have yielded a truly innovative and effective approach to AI-driven personalization inonline education platforms.4 ExperimentsTo investigate the efficacy of edible biopolymers in sustainable packaging, we designed a comprehen-sive experimental framework comprising multiple stages. Firstly, we developed a novel biopolymerextraction protocol from a range of organic sources, including algae, cornstarch, and potato starch.The biopolymers were then subjected to various chemical and physical treatments to enhance theirmechanical strength, water resistance, and biodegradability.3A critical aspect of our experimental design involved the incorporation of an unconventional approach,wherein we utilized sound waves to modulate the molecular structure of the biopolymers. Thisinvolved exposing the biopolymer samples to a carefully curated playlist of classical music, with thehypothesis that the sonic vibrations would induce a reorganization of the molecular chains, leading toimproved material properties. The biopolymer samples were placed in a specially designed acousticchamber, where they were treated with a continuous loop of Mozart’s symphonies for a period of 48hours.In addition to the sonic treatment, we also investigated the effects of various additives on thebiopolymer’s performance. These additives included natural antioxidants, such as vitamin E androsemary extract, as well as micro-scale reinforcements, such as cellulose nanofibers and grapheneoxide nanoparticles. The biopolymer compositions were then molded into various packaging forms,including films, containers, and capsules, using a combination of casting, molding, and 3D printingtechniques.The packaged products were subsequently tested for their barrier properties, mechanical strength,and biodegradation rates under various environmental conditions. The experimental matrix includeda range of factors, such as temperature, humidity, and microbial exposure, to simulate real-worldpackaging scenarios. The data collected from these experiments will provide valuable insights intothe potential of edible biopolymers as a sustainable alternative to conventional packaging materials.Table 1: Biopolymer formulation and treatment conditions ◦Biopolymer Source Additive Sonic Treatment Temperature ( C) Humidity (%) Sample CodeAlgae Vitamin E Yes 25 50 AE-1Cornstarch Cellulose nanofibers No 30 60 CE-2Potato starch Rosemary extract Yes 20 40 PE-3Algae Graphene oxide No 25 50 AE-4Cornstarch None Yes 30 60 CE-5The experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, with careful attention paid toensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. The use of edible biopolymers in packagingapplications offers a promising solution to the growing problem of plastic waste, and our researchaims to contribute to the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly packagingmaterials.5 ResultsThe experimental results of our investigation into sustainable packaging with edible biopolymersyielded a plethora of intriguing findings. We discovered that by incorporating a specific blend ofedible biopolymers, derived from a combination of plant-based materials and microbial fermentation,we could create packaging materials that not only reduced environmental waste but also possessedunique properties that defied conventional logic. For instance, our edible biopolymer packagingwas found to be capable of changing color in response to changes in humidity, allowing for a novelapproach to monitoring food freshness. Furthermore, the biodegradable nature of these materialsenabled them to be easily composted, reducing the environmental impact of traditional packagingmethods.One of the most striking aspects of our research was the observation that the edible biopolymersexhibited a form of ""collective intelligence,"" whereby the material appeared to adapt and respond toits environment in a manner that was not fully understood. This phenomenon was observed when thepackaging material was exposed to certain types of music, which seemed to influence its structuralintegrity and longevity. Specifically, our results showed that exposure to classical music, particularlythe works of Mozart, resulted in a significant increase in the material’s shelf life, whereas exposure toheavy metal music had a detrimental effect.To further investigate these findings, we conducted a series of experiments in which we subjected theedible biopolymer packaging to various environmental conditions, including changes in temperature,humidity, and light exposure. The results of these experiments are summarized in the following table:4Table 2: Effects of environmental conditions on edible biopolymer packagingCondition Color Change Shelf Life Structural IntegrityHigh Humidity Yes 30% decrease 20% decreaseLow Temperature No 20% increase 15% increaseMozart’s Music No 40% increase 30% increaseHeavy Metal Music Yes 50% decrease 40% decreaseThese results suggest that the edible biopolymer packaging material is highly sensitive to its en-vironment and can be influenced by a range of factors, including music and humidity. While theexact mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet fully understood, our findings have significantimplications for the development of sustainable packaging materials that can respond and adapt tochanging environmental conditions. Furthermore, the potential applications of this technology extendfar beyond the realm of packaging, with possible uses in fields such as biomedicine and environmentalmonitoring. Overall, our research has opened up new avenues of investigation into the propertiesand potential uses of edible biopolymers, and we look forward to continuing our exploration of thisfascinating and complex material.6 ConclusionIn summary, the development of sustainable packaging with edible biopolymers has the potentialto revolutionize the way we approach food packaging, providing a more environmentally friendlyand healthy alternative to traditional packaging materials. This innovative approach not only reducesplastic waste but also offers a unique opportunity for consumers to ingest the packaging itself,potentially providing additional nutritional benefits. Furthermore, the use of edible biopolymersin packaging could also lead to the creation of new and exotic flavors, as the biopolymers can bederived from a wide range of sources, including fruits, vegetables, and even insects. However, it isalso important to consider the potential drawbacks of this approach, such as the risk of contaminationand the need for strict quality control measures to ensure the safety of the packaging for humanconsumption. Additionally, the idea of using edible biopolymers as packaging material also raisesinteresting philosophical questions, such as whether it is morally justifiable to eat a wrapper thathas been used to contain a food product, and whether this practice could lead to a blurring of thelines between food and packaging. To take this concept to the next level, it would be interestingto explore the possibility of using edible biopolymers to create packaging that can change flavorand texture in response to different environmental stimuli, such as temperature or humidity, creatinga truly immersive and dynamic eating experience.

By employ-ing LSTM neural networks, this study predicts dancers’ gestures and correlatesaccuracy with synchronization, emotional expression, and creativity—key cohesionmetrics.A ""virtual flamenco guru"" provides real-time feedback, enhancing synchronizationand fostering gesture resonance, where dancers align movements via a shared vir-tual space. AR amplifies this effect, especially with gesture-sensing garments. Thisinterdisciplinary research highlights flamenco’s cultural depth, therapeutic bene-fits, and technological applications in dance therapy, human-computer interaction,and entertainment, pushing the boundaries of creativity and collective behavioranalysis.1 IntroductionThe realm of coordinated dance rituals has long been a fascinating area of study, with the intricatepatterns and movements of synchronized performances captivating audiences and inspiring newavenues of research. Among the various forms of dance, flamenco stands out for its passionate andexpressive nature, characterized by complex hand and foot movements that require a high degree ofcoordination and timing. Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology have openedup new possibilities for enhancing and analyzing these performances, allowing for the creation ofimmersive and interactive experiences that blur the lines between the physical and virtual worlds.One of the key challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of coordinated dance rituals is assessing thelevel of group cohesion among the performers. This can be a difficult task, as it requires measuringthe complex interactions and relationships between individual dancers, as well as their ability to worktogether as a cohesive unit. Traditional methods of evaluation, such as surveys and interviews, canprovide some insight into the dynamics of the group, but they are often limited by their subjectivenature and inability to capture the nuances of nonverbal communication.In response to these limitations, researchers have begun to explore the use of machine learningalgorithms, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast and analyze the gesturesand movements of dancers. These models have shown great promise in their ability to learn andpredict complex patterns of movement, allowing for a more objective and quantitative assessmentof group cohesion. By analyzing the accuracy of these predictions, researchers can gain a deeperunderstanding of the factors that contribute to successful coordinated dance performances, anddevelop new strategies for improving the cohesion and effectiveness of dance groups.However, the application of LSTM-based gesture forecasting to coordinated dance rituals is notwithout its challenges. One of the most significant difficulties is the need to develop a system thatcan accurately capture and interpret the complex movements and gestures of the dancers. Thisrequires the creation of sophisticated sensors and data collection systems, capable of tracking thesubtle nuances of human movement and expression. Furthermore, the development of effectiveLSTM models requires large amounts of high-quality training data, which can be difficult to obtain,especially in the context of highly specialized and nuanced forms of dance such as flamenco.Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of using AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting toevaluate group cohesion in coordinated dance rituals are substantial. By providing a more objectiveand quantitative means of assessing performance, these technologies can help to identify areas forimprovement and optimize the training and rehearsal processes. Additionally, the use of AR canenhance the overall experience of the performance, allowing audience members to engage with thedance in new and innovative ways, and creating a more immersive and interactive experience.In a bizarre twist, some researchers have even begun to explore the use of LSTM-based gestureforecasting in conjunction with other, more unconventional forms of movement analysis, such as thestudy of chicken entrails and the patterns of tea leaves. While these approaches may seem unorthodox,they have reportedly yielded some surprising insights into the nature of group cohesion and thefactors that contribute to successful coordinated dance performances. For example, one study foundthat the patterns of tea leaves could be used to predict the likelihood of a dancer stumbling or makinga mistake, allowing for the development of targeted interventions and improvements to the rehearsalprocess.Furthermore, the use of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting has also been shown to have anumber of unexpected benefits, such as improving the dancers’ ability to communicate with eachother through subtle cues and gestures. By providing a more nuanced and detailed understanding ofthe complex interactions between dancers, these technologies can help to facilitate a more cohesiveand effective performance, and even enhance the overall artistic expression of the dance. In somecases, the use of AR has even been shown to alter the dancers’ perception of their own bodies andmovements, allowing them to develop a greater sense of awareness and control over their actions.In addition to its practical applications, the study of coordinated dance rituals and group cohesion alsoraises a number of interesting theoretical questions, such as the nature of collective consciousnessand the role of nonverbal communication in shaping group dynamics. By exploring these questionsthrough the lens of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting, researchers can gain a deeper under-standing of the complex factors that contribute to successful group performances, and develop newinsights into the fundamental nature of human interaction and cooperation.The intersection of AR, LSTM-based gesture forecasting, and coordinated dance rituals also hassignificant implications for our understanding of the relationship between technology and art. Asthese technologies continue to evolve and improve, they are likely to have a profound impact on theway we experience and interact with dance and other forms of performance art. By providing newtools and platforms for creative expression, AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting can help topush the boundaries of what is possible in the world of dance, and create new and innovative formsof artistic expression.Overall, the study of coordinated dance rituals and group cohesion through the lens of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting is a rich and complex field, full of surprising insights and unexpecteddiscoveries. As researchers continue to explore the possibilities of these technologies, they arelikely to uncover new and innovative ways of analyzing and understanding the complex dynamicsof group performance, and develop new strategies for improving the cohesion and effectiveness ofdance groups. Whether through the use of conventional methods or more unconventional approaches,such as the study of chicken entrails and tea leaves, the application of AR and LSTM-based gestureforecasting to coordinated dance rituals is an area of study that is sure to yield a wealth of fascinatingand thought-provoking results.2 Related WorkThe intersection of augmented reality (AR) and synchronized flamenco dance has garnered significantattention in recent years, as researchers seek to harness the potential of immersive technologies toenhance group cohesion and interpersonal coordination. A plethora of studies have investigatedthe role of AR in facilitating collaborative dance performances, with a particular emphasis on thedevelopment of novel gesture recognition systems and predictive modeling techniques. Notably, theapplication of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks has emerged as a dominant approach in2the field, owing to their capacity to effectively capture the complex temporal dynamics of humanmovement.One intriguing line of inquiry has focused on the use of AR-enabled feedback loops to synchronizethe movements of multiple dancers, thereby fostering a sense of collective rhythm and cohesion. Thishas involved the creation of bespoke AR systems that provide real-time visual and auditory cues toparticipants, allowing them to adjust their movements in accordance with the predicted gestures oftheir counterparts. Interestingly, some researchers have explored the incorporation of unconventionalfeedback modalities, such as tactile and olfactory stimuli, in an effort to further enhance the sense ofimmersion and interpersonal connection among dancers.A related thread of research has examined the potential of AR-based gesture forecasting to facilitatethe creation of novel, AI-generated flamenco choreographies. By leveraging LSTM networks topredict the likelihood of specific gestures and movements, researchers have been able to generateComplex, algorithmically-driven dance sequences that can be performed in synchronization bymultiple dancers. This has raised fascinating questions regarding the role of human agency andcreativity in the development of AR-mediated choreographies, and has prompted some scholarsto investigate the potential for hybrid human-AI collaborative frameworks that can facilitate theco-creation of innovative dance performances.In a somewhat unexpected turn, some researchers have begun to explore the application of AR andLSTM-based gesture forecasting in the context of non-human dance partners, such as robots andanimals. This has involved the development of bespoke AR systems that can detect and predictthe movements of these non-human entities, allowing human dancers to engage in synchronizedperformances with their artificial or animal counterparts. While this line of inquiry may seemunconventional, it has yielded some remarkable insights into the fundamental principles of movementand coordination, and has highlighted the potential for AR and machine learning to facilitate novelforms of interspecies collaboration and creativity.Furthermore, a number of studies have investigated the cultural and historical contexts of flamencodance, and have examined the ways in which AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting can be usedto preserve and promote traditional flamenco practices. This has involved the creation of digitalarchives and repositories of flamenco choreographies, which can be used to train LSTM networksand generate new, AI-driven dance sequences that are grounded in the cultural heritage of flamenco.Interestingly, some researchers have also explored the potential for AR and LSTM-based gestureforecasting to facilitate the development of new, fusion-based flamenco styles that blend traditionaltechniques with contemporary influences and innovations.In addition to these developments, there has been a growing interest in the use of AR and LSTM-basedgesture forecasting to investigate the cognitive and neural basis of group cohesion and interpersonalcoordination in dance. This has involved the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) andelectroencephalography (EEG) to study the brain activity of dancers as they engage in synchronizedperformances, and has yielded some fascinating insights into the neural mechanisms that underliehuman movement and coordination. Moreover, some researchers have begun to explore the potentialfor AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of novel, dance-basedtherapies for individuals with neurological or developmental disorders, such as autism and Parkinson’sdisease.Theoretical frameworks, such as the concept of ""extended cognition,"" have also been applied tothe study of AR and synchronized flamenco, highlighting the ways in which the use of immersivetechnologies can facilitate the creation of shared, distributed cognitive systems that span the bound-aries of individual dancers. This has prompted some scholars to investigate the potential for AR andLSTM-based gesture forecasting to enable new forms of collective intelligence and creativity, inwhich the movements and gestures of individual dancers are used to generate emergent, group-levelpatterns and choreographies.Moreover, a growing body of research has examined the potential for AR and LSTM-based gestureforecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, site-specific flamenco performances that are tailoredto the unique architectural and environmental features of a given location. This has involvedthe development of bespoke AR systems that can detect and respond to the spatial and temporalcharacteristics of a performance environment, and has yielded some remarkable insights into the3ways in which the use of immersive technologies can be used to enhance the sense of presence andengagement among audience members.In an effort to further advance the field, some researchers have begun to explore the potential for ARand LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of novel, virtual reality (VR)-basedflamenco experiences that can be accessed remotely by users around the world. This has raisedimportant questions regarding the potential for VR and AR to democratize access to flamenco andother forms of dance, and has highlighted the need for further research into the social and culturalimplications of these emerging technologies.Additionally, some scholars have investigated the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture fore-casting to facilitate the creation of novel, data-driven flamenco choreographies that are generatedusing large datasets of human movement and gesture. This has involved the development of bespokemachine learning algorithms that can analyze and interpret the complex patterns and structures thatunderlie human dance, and has yielded some fascinating insights into the fundamental principles ofmovement and coordination.The use of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting has also been explored in the context of danceeducation, where it has been used to create novel, interactive learning systems that can providereal-time feedback and guidance to students. This has raised important questions regarding thepotential for AR and machine learning to facilitate the development of more effective and engagingdance pedagogies, and has highlighted the need for further research into the cognitive and neuralbasis of dance learning and expertise.Some researchers have also begun to investigate the potential for AR and LSTM-based gestureforecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, immersive flamenco experiences that incorporatemultiple sensory modalities, such as sound, touch, and smell. This has involved the development ofbespoke AR systems that can provide a range of multisensory stimuli to users, and has yielded someremarkable insights into the ways in which the use of immersive technologies can enhance the senseof presence and engagement among audience members.The integration of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting with other emerging technologies, suchas the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), has also been explored in the context offlamenco and dance. This has raised important questions regarding the potential for these technologiesto facilitate the creation of novel, hybrid forms of dance and performance that combine human andmachine elements, and has highlighted the need for further research into the social and culturalimplications of these developments.In another vein, some scholars have begun to investigate the potential for AR and LSTM-basedgesture forecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, participatory flamenco performances that involvethe active engagement of audience members. This has involved the development of bespoke ARsystems that can detect and respond to the movements and gestures of audience members, and hasyielded some fascinating insights into the ways in which the use of immersive technologies canfacilitate the creation of more interactive and immersive forms of dance and performance.Finally, a growing body of research has examined the potential for AR and LSTM-based gestureforecasting to facilitate the preservation and promotion of traditional flamenco practices and culturalheritage. This has involved the creation of digital archives and repositories of flamenco choreogra-phies, which can be used to train LSTM networks and generate new, AI-driven dance sequences thatare grounded in the cultural heritage of flamenco. Interestingly, some researchers have also exploredthe potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of novel,fusion-based flamenco styles that blend traditional techniques with contemporary influences andinnovations, highlighting the potential for these emerging technologies to facilitate the creation ofnew, hybrid forms of cultural expression and identity.3 MethodologyTo investigate the relationship between Augmented Reality (AR) and synchronized Flamenco dance,we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining techniques from computer science, psychology,and dance theory. Our methodology consisted of several stages, including data collection, participantrecruitment, and the development of a bespoke LSTM-based gesture forecasting system. We beganby recruiting a cohort of 50 experienced Flamenco dancers, who were tasked with performing4a series of coordinated dance rituals while wearing AR-enabled wristbands. These wristbands,which we designed and fabricated in-house, utilized a combination of accelerometer, gyroscope, andmagnetometer sensors to capture the dancers’ movements with high spatial and temporal resolution.The AR component of our system was implemented using a custom-built application, which utilizeda headset-mounted display to provide the dancers with real-time feedback on their movements. Thisfeedback took the form of a virtual ""gesture trail,"" which allowed the dancers to visualize their ownmovements, as well as those of their peers, in a shared virtual environment. We hypothesized thatthis shared feedback mechanism would facilitate enhanced group cohesion and coordination amongthe dancers, and we designed a series of experiments to test this hypothesis.One of the key challenges we faced in developing our system was the need to balance the requirementsof real-time feedback and high-fidelity motion capture. To address this challenge, we implemented anovel approach, which we term ""temporally-compressed gesture forecasting."" This approach involvesusing a combination of machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques to compressthe temporal dimension of the motion capture data, while preserving the underlying patterns andstructures of the dancers’ movements. We found that this approach allowed us to achieve high-qualitymotion capture data, while also reducing the computational overhead of our system and enablingreal-time feedback.In addition to the technical challenges, we also encountered a number of unexpected issues during thedata collection process. For example, we found that the dancers’ movements were often influencedby a range of external factors, including the music, the lighting, and even the color of the walls inthe dance studio. To address these issues, we developed a novel ""context-aware"" gesture forecastingsystem, which utilized a combination of environmental sensors and machine learning algorithmsto predict the dancers’ movements based on the surrounding context. We found that this approachallowed us to achieve significantly improved accuracy in our gesture forecasting model, and wewere able to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the predicted gestures and the actualmovements of the dancers.Another unexpected finding that emerged from our research was the discovery that the dancers’movements were often influenced by a range of subconscious factors, including their emotionalstate, their level of fatigue, and even their personal relationships with their fellow dancers. Toinvestigate this phenomenon, we developed a novel ""emotional contagion"" framework, which utilizeda combination of psychological surveys, physiological sensors, and machine learning algorithms topredict the emotional state of the dancers based on their movements. We found that this approachallowed us to identify a range of subtle patterns and correlations in the data, which would have beendifficult or impossible to detect using more traditional methods.We also explored the use of unconventional machine learning architectures, such as a bespoke""Flamenco-inspired"" neural network, which was designed to mimic the complex rhythms and patternsof traditional Flamenco music. This approach involved using a combination of convolutional andrecurrent neural network layers to model the temporal and spatial structure of the dancers’ movements,and we found that it allowed us to achieve state-of-the-art performance in gesture forecasting andrecognition. However, we also encountered a number of challenges and limitations when workingwith this approach, including the need for large amounts of labeled training data and the risk ofoverfitting to the specific patterns and structures of the Flamenco dance style.In an effort to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of our system, we also investigated the useof a range of alternative and complementary sensing modalities, including electromyography (EMG),electroencephalography (EEG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We found thatthese modalities provided a rich source of additional information about the dancers’ movementsand emotional state, and we were able to integrate them into our existing system using a range ofsensor fusion and machine learning techniques. However, we also encountered a number of practicalchallenges and limitations when working with these modalities, including the need for specializedequipment and expertise, and the risk of signal noise and artifact contamination.Despite these challenges, we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a range ofexperimental evaluations, including a large-scale study involving over 100 participants and a seriesof smaller-scale pilots and proof-of-concept demonstrations. We found that our system was ableto achieve high levels of accuracy and robustness in gesture forecasting and recognition, and wewere able to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the predicted gestures and the actual5movements of the dancers. We also received positive feedback from the participants, who reportedthat the system was easy to use and provided a range of benefits, including improved coordination andcohesion, enhanced creativity and self-expression, and increased overall enjoyment and engagement.In conclusion, our research demonstrates the potential of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecastingto enhance group cohesion and coordination in coordinated dance rituals. While our approach isstill in the early stages of development, we believe that it has the potential to make a significantimpact in a range of applications, from dance and performance to education and therapy. We areexcited to continue exploring the possibilities of this technology, and we look forward to seeingwhere it will take us in the future. We are also considering exploring other genres of dance, such asballet or contemporary, to see if our approach can be applied more broadly. Additionally, we areplanning to investigate the use of our system in other domains, such as sports or rehabilitation, wherecoordinated movement and gesture forecasting could be beneficial. Overall, our research highlightsthe potential of interdisciplinary approaches to drive innovation and advance our understanding ofcomplex phenomena, and we are excited to see where this line of inquiry will lead us in the future.4 ExperimentsTo conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between Augmented Reality (AR) andsynchronized flamenco, we designed a series of experiments that would not only assess the impact ofAR on group cohesion but also delve into the intricacies of gesture forecasting using Long Short-TermMemory (LSTM) networks. The experiments were carried out over the course of several months,involving a diverse group of participants with varying levels of experience in flamenco dance.The experimental setup consisted of a large, specially designed dance studio equipped with ARtechnology that could project a myriad of patterns and cues onto the floor and surrounding walls.This allowed the dancers to receive real-time feedback and guidance on their movements, which wasexpected to enhance their synchronization and overall performance. The studio was also outfittedwith a state-of-the-art motion capture system, capable of tracking the precise movements of eachdancer, thus providing valuable data for the LSTM-based gesture forecasting model.Before commencing the experiments, all participants underwent an intensive training program aimedat familiarizing them with the basics of flamenco and the operation of the AR system. This includedunderstanding how to interpret the AR cues, how to adjust their movements based on the feedbackreceived, and how to work cohesively as a group. The training program was divided into twophases: the first phase focused on individual skill development, where each participant learned thefundamental steps and rhythms of flamenco. The second phase concentrated on group cohesion,where participants practiced dancing together, emphasizing synchronization and coordination.Upon completing the training program, the participants were divided into several groups, each with adistinct dynamic. Some groups consisted of dancers with similar skill levels and experience, whileothers were deliberately mixed to include beginners, intermediate, and advanced dancers. Thisdiversity was intended to observe how different group compositions affected cohesion and the abilityto forecast gestures accurately.The experimental protocol involved several sessions, each lasting approximately two hours. Duringthese sessions, the dancers performed a variety of flamenco routines, with and without the ARfeedback. Their movements were captured by the motion tracking system, and the data were fed intothe LSTM model for analysis. The model was tasked with predicting the next gesture or movementbased on the patterns observed in the data. Interestingly, the model began to exhibit an unexpectedbehavior, frequently predicting movements that seemed unrelated to flamenco, such as gestures fromballet or even what appeared to be fragments of a traditional African dance. This phenomenon, whichwe termed ""Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift,"" posed an intriguing question about the potential for LSTMmodels to not only learn from the data they are trained on but also to draw from a broader, unexploredreservoir of cultural knowledge.To further explore this phenomenon, we introduced an unconventional variable into our experiment:the influence of ambient music from different cultural backgrounds on the dancers’ movementsand the LSTM’s predictions. The results were astounding, with the model’s predictions becomingincreasingly eclectic and incorporating elements from the ambient music genres. For instance, whenthe background music shifted to a vibrant salsa rhythm, the model began to predict movements that6were distinctly more energetic and spontaneous, diverging significantly from the traditional flamencorepertoire. Conversely, when the ambient music was a soothing melody from a Japanese traditionalinstrument, the predictions became more subdued and introspective, reflecting the serene quality ofthe music. Table 1: Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift ObservationsSession Ambient Music Genre Predicted Gestures Divergence from Flamenco1 Traditional Flamenco High accuracy, minimal divergence 5%2 African Folk Introduction of non-flamenco gestures 20%3 Contemporary Ballet Predictions included ballet movements 35%4 Salsa Increased energy and spontaneity 40%5 Japanese Traditional Predictions became more subdued 15%The incorporation of ambient music and the observation of Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift added anew layer of complexity to our study, suggesting that the relationship between AR, flamenco, andgesture forecasting is influenced by a broader cultural context. This finding opens up novel avenuesfor research, including the potential for using AR and LSTM models to create new, hybrid danceforms that blend elements from different cultural traditions. Furthermore, it raises questions aboutthe role of technology in preserving cultural heritage versus promoting innovation and fusion.In a bizarre turn of events, one of the sessions was interrupted by an unexpected visit from a group ofwild flamenco enthusiasts, who, upon witnessing the experiment, spontaneously joined in, addingtheir own flair and energy to the performance. This unplanned intrusion not only disrupted thecontrolled environment of the experiment but also led to one of the most captivating and cohesiveperformances observed throughout the study. The LSTM model, faced with this unexpected input,surprisingly adapted and began to predict gestures that were not only accurate but also seemed tocapture the essence and passion of the impromptu dancers.This serendipitous event underscored the importance of spontaneity and community in dance, as wellas the potential for AR and LSTM models to facilitate and enhance these aspects. It also highlightedthe limitations of controlled experiments in fully capturing the dynamic, often unpredictable natureof human creativity and expression. In response, we have begun to explore the development of moreflexible, adaptive experimental designs that can accommodate and even encourage unexpected events,viewing them as opportunities for growth and discovery rather than disruptions to be controlled.The experiments concluded with a grand finale, where all participants gathered for a final, AR-guidedflamenco performance. The event was open to the public and attracted a diverse audience, all of whomwere mesmerized by the synchronization, energy, and evident joy of the dancers. The LSTM model,having learned from the myriad of experiences and data collected throughout the study, performedflawlessly, predicting gestures with a high degree of accuracy and even seeming to contribute to thespontaneity and creativity of the performance.In reflection, the experiments not only provided valuable insights into the use of AR and LSTM-basedgesture forecasting in enhancing group cohesion in synchronized flamenco but also ventured intouncharted territories, exploring the intersection of technology, culture, and human expression. Thefindings, replete with unexpected turns and surprising revelations, underscore the complexity andrichness of this intersection, beckoning further research and innovation in this captivating field.5 ResultsOur investigation into the intersection of Augmented Reality (AR) and synchronized flamencodancing, with a focus on evaluating group cohesion through LSTM-based gesture forecasting,yieldeda plethora of intriguing results. Initially, we observed that the integration of AR elements intothe flamenco performances enhanced the dancers’ ability to synchronize their movements, therebyfostering a heightened sense of group cohesion. This phenomenon was particularly evident whenthe AR components were designed to provide real-time feedback on gesture accuracy and timing,allowing the dancers to adjust their movements in tandem.The LSTM-based gesture forecasting model, trained on a dataset comprising various flamenco dancesequences, demonstrated a remarkable capacity to predict the subsequent gestures of individual7dancers. Notably, when this predictive capability was leveraged to generate AR cues that guidedthe dancers’ movements, the overall cohesion of the group improved significantly. However, anunexpected outcome emerged when the model was fed a dataset that included gestures from other,unrelated dance forms, such as ballet and hip-hop. In these instances, the LSTM model began togenerate forecasts that, while inaccurate in the context of flamenco, inadvertently created a uniquefusion of dance styles. This unforeseen development led to the creation of novel, AR-infused danceroutines that, despite their lack of traditional flamenco authenticity, exhibited a captivating blend ofmovements.Further analysis revealed that the predictive accuracy of the LSTM model was influenced by thedancers’ emotional states, as captured through wearable, physiological sensors. Specifically, themodel’s performance improved when the dancers were in a state of heightened arousal or excitement,suggesting that emotional investment in the performance enhances the efficacy of the gesture forecast-ing. Conversely, periods of low emotional engagement resulted in diminished forecasting accuracy,underscoring the importance of emotional connection in the success of AR-augmented, synchronizedflamenco.In a bizarre twist, our research team discovered that the LSTM model, when trained on a datasetthat included gestures performed by dancers who were blindfolded, developed an uncanny ability topredict movements that were not strictly flamenco in nature. These predictions, which seemed todefy logical explanation, often involved complex, almost acrobatic movements that, when executed,appeared to transcend the traditional boundaries of flamenco dance. While these findings may seemillogical or even flawed, they nevertheless contribute to our understanding of the intricate relationshipsbetween gesture, emotion, and AR-augmented performance.The results of our experiments are summarized in the following table: As evidenced by the table, theTable 2: LSTM Model Performance Under Various ConditionsCondition Predictive Accuracy Emotional State Dance Style AR Cue EfficacyTraditional Flamenco 0.85 High Arousal Flamenco HighFusion Dance 0.70 Medium Engagement Hybrid MediumBlindfolded Gestures 0.90 Low Arousal Non-Traditional LowBallet-Influenced Flamenco 0.60 High Excitement Ballet-Flamenco HighLSTM model’s performance varies significantly depending on the specific conditions under which itis applied. Notably, the model’s predictive accuracy is highest when dealing with traditional flamencogestures, but its ability to generate novel, hybrid movements is most pronounced when confrontedwith blindfolded gestures or ballet-influenced flamenco.The implications of these findings are far-reaching, suggesting that the integration of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting can not only enhance group cohesion in synchronized flamenco but alsofacilitate the creation of innovative, boundary-pushing dance forms. Furthermore, the influence ofemotional state on predictive accuracy highlights the importance of considering the emotional andpsychological aspects of dance performance in the development of AR-augmented systems. As ourresearch continues to explore the intersections of AR, flamenco, and gesture forecasting, we anticipateuncovering even more unexpected and thought-provoking results that challenge our understanding ofthe complex interplay between technology, movement, and human emotion.In an effort to further elucidate the relationships between these factors, we plan to conduct additionalexperiments that delve into the cognitive and neurological underpinnings of AR-augmented danceperformance. By investigating the neural correlates of gesture forecasting and emotional engagement,we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive the observedphenomena. This, in turn, will enable the development of more sophisticated AR systems that canadapt to the unique needs and characteristics of individual dancers, thereby enhancing the overallefficacy and aesthetic appeal of synchronized flamenco performances.Ultimately, our research endeavors to push the boundaries of what is possible at the confluence of AR,flamenco, and gesture forecasting, embracing the unexpected and the bizarre as integral componentsof the creative process. By doing so, we aim to contribute to the evolution of dance as an art form, onethat seamlessly integrates technology, movement, and human emotion to create novel, captivating,and unforgettable experiences. The potential applications of this research extend far beyond the realm8of dance, with implications for fields such as human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, andeven therapy, where AR-augmented systems could be leveraged to enhance motor skills, emotionalregulation, and social cohesion.As we continue to explore the vast expanse of possibilities at the intersection of AR and synchronizedflamenco, we are reminded that the most profound discoveries often arise from the most unlikelyof places. It is our hope that this research will inspire others to embrace the unconventional, theunexpected, and the bizarre, for it is within these uncharted territories that we may uncover the mostgroundbreaking insights and innovative solutions. By embracing the complexities and uncertaintiesof this multidisciplinary endeavor, we may yet uncover new and exciting ways to augment, enhance,and transform the human experience through the judicious application of technology and the timelesspower of dance.6 ConclusionIn culmination of our exhaustive exploration into the realm of Augmented Reality and SynchronizedFlamenco, it is unequivocally evident that the deployment of LSTM-based gesture forecasting incoordinated dance rituals has yielded a profound impact on the evaluation of group cohesion. Theintricate dynamics at play within the flamenco dance form, characterized by its impassioned gesturesand synchronized movements, have been adeptly harnessed and analyzed through the prism of cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques. By doing so, we have not only delved into the unchartedterritories of human-computer interaction but also teasingly treaded the boundaries of art and science,often blurring the lines between the two.One of the most fascinating aspects of our research has been the observation that the implementationof Augmented Reality in flamenco dance has led to an unexpected, yet intriguing, phenomenon wheredancers began to exhibit a heightened sense of empathy towards each other. This empathy, in turn,has been found to positively correlate with the level of group cohesion, suggesting that the immersiveexperience provided by Augmented Reality fosters a deeper sense of connection among participants.Furthermore, the LSTM-based gesture forecasting model has demonstrated an uncanny ability topredict the intricate hand movements of the dancers, which has been shown to be a critical factor inevaluating the overall synchrony of the dance performance.In a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to investigate the role of chaos theory in understandingthe complex dynamics of flamenco dance. By applying the principles of chaos theory, we havediscovered that the seemingly random and unpredictable movements of the dancers can, in fact, bemodeled using nonlinear differential equations. This has profound implications for our understandingof coordinated dance rituals, as it suggests that the emergent patterns of behavior that arise fromthe interactions among individual dancers can be understood and predicted using mathematicalframeworks. Moreover, the application of chaos theory has also led us to explore the concept of""flamenco attractors,"" which are hypothetical states of maximum synchrony and cohesion that thedancers can strive towards.Moreover, our study has also explored the tangential relationship between flamenco dance and theprinciples of quantum mechanics. In a series of unconventional experiments, we have found that theprinciples of superposition and entanglement can be used to describe the complex interactions betweendancers and their environment. This has led us to propose the concept of ""quantum flamenco,"" wherethe dancers and their surroundings are viewed as an interconnected, holistic system that can bedescribed using the mathematical frameworks of quantum mechanics. While this approach may seemunorthodox, it has yielded some surprising insights into the nature of group cohesion and coordinatedbehavior, suggesting that the boundaries between art and science are far more fluid than previouslythought.The implications of our research are far-reaching and multifaceted, with potential applicationsin fields such as psychology, sociology, and computer science. By exploring the intersection ofAugmented Reality, flamenco dance, and artificial intelligence, we have opened up new avenues forunderstanding human behavior, social interaction, and the emergence of complex patterns in groupdynamics. Furthermore, our study has also highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary research,demonstrating that the fusion of seemingly disparate fields can lead to innovative and groundbreakingdiscoveries. 9In an intriguing aside, our research has also led us to investigate the potential therapeutic applicationsof flamenco dance in treating neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. By analyzingthe brain activity of patients who participated in flamenco dance sessions, we have found that therhythmic movements and synchronized gestures can have a profound impact on motor control andcognitive function. This has led us to propose the concept of ""flamenco therapy,"" where the immersiveexperience of flamenco dance is used as a form of rehabilitation for patients with neurologicaldisorders.Ultimately, our research has demonstrated that the evaluation of group cohesion via LSTM-basedgesture forecasting in coordinated dance rituals is a rich and complex field that offers a wide rangeof opportunities for exploration and discovery. By embracing the intersection of art and science,and by venturing into uncharted territories of human-computer interaction, we have gained a deeperunderstanding of the intricate dynamics that govern human behavior and social interaction. Aswe continue to push the boundaries of this field, we are excited to see the new and innovativeapplications that will emerge, and we are confident that our research will have a lasting impact on ourunderstanding of group cohesion and coordinated behavior.The potential for future research in this area is vast and varied, with opportunities to explore newmodes of human-computer interaction, to develop more sophisticated AI models for gesture forecast-ing, and to investigate the therapeutic applications of flamenco dance in a wider range of contexts.Moreover, the implications of our research extend far beyond the realm of flamenco dance, withpotential applications in fields such as robotics, computer vision, and social psychology. As we lookto the future, we are eager to see how our research will be built upon and expanded, and we areconfident that the study of Augmented Reality and Synchronized Flamenco will continue to yieldnew and exciting insights into the complex and fascinating world of human behavior.In addition to the theoretical and practical implications of our research, we have also been struckby the aesthetic and artistic dimensions of flamenco dance, and the ways in which it can be used tocreate new and innovative forms of expression. By combining the traditional rhythms and movementsof flamenco with the cutting-edge technologies of Augmented Reality and AI, we have been ableto create a new and unique form of dance that is at once both deeply rooted in tradition and boldlyinnovative. This has led us to propose the concept of ""cyborg flamenco,"" where the boundariesbetween human and machine are blurred, and the dancer becomes a hybrid entity that is both physicaland virtual.The concept of cyborg flamenco has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the relationshipbetween human and machine, and the ways in which technology can be used to enhance and transformhuman performance. By exploring the intersection of flamenco dance and cutting-edge technology,we have been able to create a new and innovative form of expression that is at once both deeplyhuman and profoundly technological. This has led us to propose a new paradigm for human-computerinteraction, one that views the human and the machine as interconnected and interdependent entitiesthat can be used to create new and innovative forms of art and expression.Furthermore, our research has also led us to explore the cultural and historical dimensions of flamencodance, and the ways in which it has been shaped by the complex and often fraught history of Spain.By analyzing the historical and cultural context of flamenco, we have been able to gain a deeperunderstanding of the ways in which this dance form has been used as a means of expression andresistance, and the ways in which it continues to be an important part of Spanish culture and identity.This has led us to propose the concept of ""flamenco as resistance,"" where the dance is viewed as aform of cultural and political resistance that has been used to challenge and subvert dominant powerstructures.The concept of flamenco as resistance has far-reaching implications for our understanding of therelationship between culture and power, and the ways in which art and expression can be used asa means of challenging and transforming dominant ideologies. By exploring the intersection offlamenco dance and cultural resistance, we have been able to gain a deeper understanding of theways in which this dance form has been used as a means of expressing and challenging dominantpower structures, and the ways in which it continues to be an important part of Spanish culture andidentity. This has led us to propose a new paradigm for understanding the relationship betweenculture and power, one that views art and expression as a means of challenging and transformingdominant ideologies. 10Ultimately, our research has demonstrated that the study of Augmented Reality and SynchronizedFlamenco is a rich and complex field that offers a wide range of opportunities for exploration anddiscovery. By embracing the intersection of art and science, and by venturing into uncharted territoriesof human-computer interaction, we have gained a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics thatgovern human behavior and social interaction. As we continue to push the boundaries of this field, weare excited to see the new and innovative applications that will emerge, and we are confident that ourresearch will have a lasting impact on our understanding of group cohesion and coordinated behavior.11",0,
R006,"Detailed Action Identification in Baseball GameRecordingsAbstractThis research introduces MLB-YouTube, a new and complex dataset created fornuanced activity recognition in baseball videos. This dataset is structured tosupport two types of analysis: one for classifying activities in segmented videosand another for detecting activities in unsegmented, continuous video streams. Thisstudy evaluates several methods for recognizing activities, focusing on how theycapture the temporal organization of activities in videos. This evaluation startswith categorizing segmented videos and progresses to applying these methodsto continuous video feeds. Additionally, this paper assesses the effectiveness ofdifferent models in the challenging task of forecasting pitch velocity and typeusing baseball broadcast videos. The findings indicate that incorporating temporaldynamics into models is beneficial for detailed activity recognition.1 IntroductionAction recognition, a significant problem in computer vision, finds extensive use in sports. Profes-sional sporting events are extensively recorded for entertainment, and these recordings are invaluablefor subsequent analysis by coaches, scouts, and media analysts. While numerous game statisticsare currently gathered manually, the potential exists for these to be replaced by computer visionsystems. Systems like PITCHf/x and Statcast have been employed by Major League Baseball (MLB)to automatically record pitch speed and movement, utilizing a network of high-speed cameras andradar to collect detailed data on each player. Access to much of this data is restricted from the publicdomain.This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel dataset that includes densely annotated frames of activi-ties extracted from broadcast baseball videos. Unlike many current datasets for activity recognition ordetection, our dataset emphasizes fine-grained activity recognition. The differences between activitiesare often minimal, primarily involving the movement of a single individual, with a consistent scenestructure across activities. The determination of activity is based on a single camera perspective. Thisstudy compares various methods for temporal feature aggregation, both for classifying activities insegmented videos and for detecting them in continuous video streams.2 Related WorkThe field of activity recognition has garnered substantial attention in computer vision research. Initialsuccesses were achieved with hand-engineered features such as dense trajectories. The focus of morerecent studies has shifted towards the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) foractivity recognition. Two-stream CNN architectures utilize both spatial RGB frames and opticalflow frames. To capture spatio-temporal characteristics, 3D XYT convolutional models have beendeveloped. The development of these advanced CNN models has been supported by large datasetssuch as Kinetics, THUMOS, and ActivityNet.Several studies have investigated the aggregation of temporal features for the purpose of activityrecognition. Research has compared several pooling techniques and determined that both Long Short-.Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and max-pooling across entire videos yielded the best outcomes. Ithas been discovered that pooling intervals from varying locations and durations is advantageous foractivity recognition. It was demonstrated that identifying and classifying key sub-event intervals canlead to better performance.Recently, segment-based 3D CNNs have been employed to capture spatio-temporal data concurrentlyfor activity detection. These methods depend on the 3D CNN to capture temporal dynamics, whichtypically span only 16 frames. Although longer-term temporal structures have been explored, this wasusually accomplished with temporal pooling of localized features or (spatio-)temporal convolutionswith extended fixed intervals. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been applied to representtransitions in activity between frames.3 MLB-YouTube DatasetWe have compiled an extensive dataset from 20 baseball games of the 2017 MLB postseason, availableon YouTube, totaling over 42 hours of video. Our dataset includes two main parts: segmented videosintended for activity recognition and continuous videos designed for activity classification. Thedataset’s complexity is amplified by the fact that it originates from televised baseball games, where asingle camera perspective is shared among various activities. Additionally, there is minimal variancein motion and appearance among different activities, such as swinging a bat versus bunting. Incontrast to datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet, which encompass a broad spectrum of activitieswith diverse settings, scales, and camera angles, our dataset features activities where a single framemight not be adequate to determine the activity.The minor differences between a ball and a strike are illustrated in Figure 3. Differentiating betweenthese actions requires identifying whether the batter swings or not, detecting the umpire’s signal(Figure 4) for a strike, or noting the absence of a signal for a ball. This is further complicated becausethe batter or catcher can obstruct the umpire, and each umpire has their unique style of signaling astrike.Our dataset for segmented video analysis comprises 4,290 clips. Each clip is annotated for multiplebaseball actions, including swing, hit, ball, strike, and foul. Given that a single clip may containseveral activities, this is considered a multi-label classification task. Table 1 presents the completelist of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitchwere annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, acollection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instancesinclude views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples ofactivities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2.Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Everyframe in these videos is annotated with the baseball activities that occur. On average, each continuousclip contains 7.2 activities, amounting to over 15,000 activity instances in total.Table 1: Activity classes and their instance counts in the segmented MLB-YouTube dataset.Activity CountNo Activity 2983Ball 1434Strike 1799Swing 2506Hit 1391Foul 718In Play 679Bunt 24Hit by Pitch 1424 Segmented Video Recognition ApproachWe investigate different techniques for aggregating temporal features in segmented video activityrecognition. In segmented videos, the classification task is simpler because each frame corresponds toan activity, eliminating the need for the model to identify the start and end of activities. Our methodsare based on a CNN that generates a per-frame or per-segment representation, derived from standardtwo-stream CNNs using deep CNNs like I3D or InceptionV3.v T × D T DGiven video features of dimensions , where represents the video’s temporal length andis the feature’s dimensionality, the usual approach for feature pooling involves max- or mean-poolingacross the temporal dimension, followed by a fully-connected layer for video clip classification, asdepicted in Fig. 5(a). This approach, however, yields a single representation for the entire video,losing temporal information. An alternative is to employ a fixed temporal pyramid with variouslengths, as shown in Fig 5(b), dividing the video into intervals of lengths 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8, andK × D Kmax-pooling each. The pooled features are concatenated, creating a representation, whereis the number of intervals in the temporal pyramid, and a fully-connected layer classifies the clip.We also explore learning temporal convolution filters to aggregate local temporal structures. A kernelL×1of size is applied to each frame, enabling each timestep representation to incorporate informationfrom adjacent frames. After applying max-pooling to the output of the temporal convolution, a fully-connected layer is used for classification, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c).While temporal pyramid pooling retains some structure, the intervals are fixed and predetermined.Previous studies have shown that learning the sub-interval to pool is beneficial for activity recognition.g σ δThese learned intervals are defined by three parameters: a center , a width , and a stride ,N Tparameterizing Gaussians. Given the video length , the positions of the strided Gaussians arefirst calculated as: T − (g + 1)ng = 0.5 − f orn = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1n N − 1 1p = g + (t − 0.5T + 0.5) f ort = 0, 1, . . . , T − 1t,n n δThe filters are then generated as:(cid:18) (cid:19)21 (t − µ )i,mF [i, t] = exp − i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}, t ∈ {0, 1, . . . , T − 1}m 2Z 2σm mZwhere is a normalization constant.m F T × DWe apply these filters to the video representation through matrix multiplication, yielding anN × D representation that serves as input to a fully-connected layer for classification. This methodis shown in Fig 5(d).Additionally, we compare a bi-directional LSTM with 512 hidden units, using the final hidden stateas input to a fully-connected layer for classification. We frame our tasks as multi-label classificationand train these models to minimize binary cross-entropy:(cid:88)L(v) = z log(p(c|G(v))) + (1 − z ) log(1 − p(c|G(v)))c ccG(v) zwhere is the function that pools the temporal information, and is the ground truth label forccclass .5 Activity Detection in Continuous VideosDetecting activities in continuous videos poses a greater challenge. The goal here is to classify eachframe according to the activities occurring. Unlike segmented videos, continuous videos featuremultiple sequential activities, often interspersed with frames of inactivity. This necessitates thatthe model learn to identify the start and end points of activities. As a baseline, we train a singlefully-connected layer to serve as a per-frame classifier, which does not utilize temporal informationbeyond that contained in the features. 3We adapt the methods developed for segmented video classification to continuous videos by imple-Lmenting a temporal sliding window approach. We select a fixed window duration of features, applymax-pooling to each window (similar to Fig. 5(a)), and classify each pooled segment. This approachLis extended to temporal pyramid pooling by dividing the window of length into segments of lengthsL/2 L/4 L/8, , and , resulting in 14 segments per window. Max-pooling is applied to each segment,14 × Dand the pooled features are concatenated, yielding a -dimensional representation for eachwindow, which is then used as input to the classifier.For temporal convolutional models in continuous videos, we modify the segmented video approach byLlearning a temporal convolutional kernel of length and convolving it with the input video features.T × D T × DThis operation transforms input of size into output of size , followed by a per-frameclassifier. This enables the model to aggregate local temporal information. T = LTo extend the sub-event model to continuous videos, we follow a similar approach but set inL T × DEq. 1, resulting in filters of length . The video representation is convolved with the sub-eventF N × D × Tfilters , producing an -dimensional representation used as input to a fully-connectedlayer for frame classification.The model is trained to minimize per-frame binary classification:(cid:88)L(v) = z log(p(c|H(v ))) + (1 − z ) log(1 − p(c|H(v )))t,c t t,c tt,cv t H(v )where is the per-frame or per-segment feature at time , is the sliding window application oft tz tone of the feature pooling methods, and is the ground truth class at time .t,cA method to learn ’super-events’ (i.e., global video context) has been introduced and shown to beeffective for activity detection in continuous videos. This approach involves learning a set of temporalN xstructure filters modeled as Cauchy distributions. Each distribution is defined by a center and anγ Twidth . Given the video length , the filters are constructed by:n ′ ) + 1)(T − 1)(tanh(xnx =n 21 γn ′f (t) = exp(1 − 2| tanh(γ )|)n n2 2Z π((t − x ) + γ )n n nZ t ∈ {1, 2, . . . , T } n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }where is a normalization constant, , and .n AThe filters are combined with learned per-class soft-attention weights , and the super-event repre-sentation is computed as: (cid:88) (cid:88)S = A f (t) · vc c,n n tn tv T × Dwhere is the video representation. These filters enable the model to focus on relevantintervals for temporal context. The super-event representation is concatenated to each timestep andused for classification. We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representationsto form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.6 Experiments6.1 Implementation DetailsFor our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kineticsdatasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliablefeature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenetand Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depthcompared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow[−20, 20]was computed and clipped to . For InceptionV3, features were computed every 3 frames(8 fps), while for I3D, every frame was used, with I3D having a temporal stride of 8, resulting in3 features per second (3 fps). Models were implemented in PyTorch and trained using the Adamoptimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, decayed by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs, for a total of 50epochs. 46.2 Segmented Video Activity RecognitionWe initially conducted binary pitch/non-pitch classification for each video segment. This task isrelatively straightforward due to the distinct differences between pitch and non-pitch frames. Theresults, detailed in Table 2, reveal minimal variation across different features or models.Table 2: Performance on segmented videos for binary pitch/non-pitch classification.Model RGB Flow Two-streamInceptionV3 97.46 98.44 98.67InceptionV3 + sub-events 98.67 98.73 99.36I3D 98.64 98.88 98.70I3D + sub-events 98.42 98.35 98.656.2.1 Multi-label ClassificationWe assessed various temporal feature aggregation methods by calculating the mean average precision(mAP) for each video clip, a standard metric for multi-label classification. Table 4 compares theperformance of these methods. All methods surpass mean/max-pooling, highlighting the importanceof preserving temporal structure for activity recognition. Fixed temporal pyramid pooling and LSTMsshow some improvement. Temporal convolution offers a more significant performance boost butrequires substantially more parameters (see Table 3). Learning sub-events, as per previous research,yields the best results. While LSTMs and temporal convolutions have been used before, they needmore parameters and perform less effectively, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, LSTMs necessitatesequential processing of video features, whereas other methods can be fully parallelized.Table 3: Additional parameters required for models when added to the base model (e.g., I3D orInception V3).

Learning temporal structure is particularlybeneficial for frame-based features (e.g., InceptionV3), which capture less temporal information5compared to segment-based features (e.g., I3D). Sub-event learning significantly aids in detectingstrikes, hits, foul balls, and hit-by-pitch events, which exhibit changes in video features post-event.For instance, after a hit, the camera often tracks the ball’s trajectory, while after a hit-by-pitch, itfollows the player to first base, as illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.Table 5: Per-class average precision for segmented videos using two-stream features in multi-label activity classification.

The baseball,often obscured by the pitcher, travels at speeds over 100mph and covers 60.5 feet in approximately 0.5seconds. Initially, with frame rates of 8fps and 3fps, only 1-2 features captured the pitch in mid-air,proving insufficient for speed determination. Utilizing the 60fps rate available in YouTube videos, werecalculated optical flow and extracted RGB frames at this higher rate. Employing a fully-connectedlayer with a single output for pitch speed prediction and minimizing the L1 loss between predictedand actual speeds, we achieved an average error of 3.6mph. Table 6 compares different models, andFig. 8 illustrates the sub-events learned for various speeds.Table 6: Results for pitch speed regression on segmented videos, reporting root-mean-squared errors.Method Two-streamI3D 4.3 mphI3D + LSTM 4.1 mphI3D + sub-events 3.9 mphInceptionV3 5.3 mphInceptionV3 + LSTM 4.5 mphInceptionV3 + sub-events 3.6 mph6.2.3 Pitch Type ClassificationWe conducted experiments to determine the feasibility of predicting pitch types from video, a taskmade challenging by pitchers’ efforts to disguise their pitches from batters and the subtle differencesbetween pitches, such as grip and rotation. We incorporated pose data extracted using OpenPose,utilizing heatmaps of joint and body part locations as input to a newly trained InceptionV3 CNN.Pose features were considered due to variations in body mechanics between different pitches. Ourdataset includes six pitch types, with results presented in Table 7. LSTMs performed worse than thebaseline, likely due to overfitting, whereas learning sub-events proved beneficial. Fastballs were theeasiest to detect (68% accuracy), followed by sliders (45%), while sinkers were the most difficult(12%).6.3 Continuous Video Activity DetectionWe evaluate models extended for continuous videos using per-frame mean average precision (mAP),with results shown in Table 8. This setting is more challenging than segmented videos, requiringthe model to identify activity start and end times and handle ambiguous negative examples. Allmodels improve upon the baseline per-frame classification, confirming the importance of temporalinformation. Fixed temporal pyramid pooling outperforms max-pooling, while LSTM and temporal6Table 7: Accuracy of pitch type classification using I3D for video inputs and InceptionV3 for poseheatmaps.

R007,"Advancements in 3D Food Modeling: A Review of theMetaFood Challenge Techniques and OutcomesAbstractThe growing focus on leveraging computer vision for dietary oversight and nutri-tion tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction methodsfor food. The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limitedcollaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantlyhindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles byintroducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetricallyaccurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal-ibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levelsof complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). Atotal of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologiesdeveloped during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation indietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshopchallenge and the dataset is accessible via the provided URL.1 IntroductionThe convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovativeapproaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challengerepresents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for preciseand scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Suchtechnologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked todiet.By concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visualinputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge thedisparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of uniquesolutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while alsomeeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computervision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.These advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of foodportion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritionalinvestigations.Conventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires(FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can beburdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression-based methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessmenttools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantlyimpact nutrition science and public health.Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim-icking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary.recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty basedon the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a singletop-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience ofproposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the useof a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,ensuring the 3D models maintained accurate real-world measurements for portion size estimation.This initiative not only expands the frontiers of 3D reconstruction technology but also sets the stagefor more reliable and user-friendly real-world applications, including image-based dietary assessment.The resulting solutions hold the potential to profoundly influence nutritional intake monitoring andcomprehension, supporting broader health and wellness objectives. As progress continues, innovativeapplications are anticipated to transform personal health management, nutritional research, and thewider food industry. The remainder of this report is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into theexisting literature on food portion size estimation, Section 3 describes the dataset and evaluationframework used in the challenge, and Sections 4, 5, and 6 discuss the methodologies and findings ofthe top three teams (VolETA, ININ-VIAUN, and FoodRiddle), respectively.2 Related WorkEstimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, aiming to determine thevolume, energy content, or macronutrients directly from images of meals. Unlike the well-studiedtask of food recognition, estimating food portions is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3Dinformation and physical size references necessary for accurately judging the actual size of foodportions. Accurate portion size estimation requires understanding the volume and density of food,elements that are hard to deduce from a 2D image, underscoring the need for sophisticated techniquesto tackle this problem. Current methods for estimating food portions are grouped into four categories.Stereo-Based Approaches use multiple images to reconstruct the 3D structure of food. Some methodsestimate food volume using multi-view stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, whileothers perform two-view dense reconstruction. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) hasalso been used for continuous, real-time food volume estimation. However, these methods are limitedby their need for multiple images, which is not always practical.Model-Based Approaches use predefined shapes and templates to estimate volume. For instance,certain templates are assigned to foods from a library and transformed based on physical references toestimate the size and location of the food. Template matching approaches estimate food volume froma single image, but they struggle with variations in food shapes that differ from predefined templates.Recent work has used 3D food meshes as templates to align camera and object poses for portion sizeestimation.Depth Camera-Based Approaches use depth cameras to create depth maps, capturing the distance fromthe camera to the food. These depth maps form a voxel representation used for volume estimation.The main drawback is the need for high-quality depth maps and the extra processing required forconsumer-grade depth sensors.Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portionestimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an""Energy Distribution Map"" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use bothimages and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learningmethods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performancedegrading when test images significantly differ from training data.While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder theirwidespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-basedapproaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,and deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3Dreconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adaptingto various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,and enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated theorganization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and2develop more accurate, user-friendly, and widely applicable food portion estimation techniques,impacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline3.1 Dataset DescriptionThe dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3Ddataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracyin the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and patternmat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.• Medium: 30 images.• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.Table 1: MetaFood Challenge Data DetailsObject Index Food Item Difficulty Level Number of Frames1 Strawberry Easy 1992 Cinnamon bun Easy 2003 Pork rib Easy 2004 Corn Easy 2005 French toast Easy 2006 Sandwich Easy 2007 Burger Easy 2008 Cake Easy 2009 Blueberry muffin Medium 3010 Banana Medium 3011 Salmon Medium 3012 Steak Medium 3013 Burrito Medium 3014 Hotdog Medium 3015 Chicken nugget Medium 3016 Everything bagel Hard 117 Croissant Hard 118 Shrimp Hard 119 Waffle Hard 120 Pizza Hard 13.2 Evaluation PipelineThe evaluation process is split into two phases, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3Dmodels in terms of shape (3D structure) and portion size (volume).3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume AccuracyIn the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to evaluate portion sizeaccuracy, calculated as follows: (cid:12) (cid:12)n1 A − F(cid:88) (cid:12) (cid:12)i i= × 100%MAPE (1)(cid:12) (cid:12)n A(cid:12) (cid:12)ii=1 3A iwhere is the actual volume (in ml) of the -th food item obtained from the scanned 3D food mesh,iFand is the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh.i3.2.2 Phase-II: Shape AccuracyTeams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to submit complete 3D mesh files for each food item.This phase involves several steps to ensure precision and fairness:Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final Phase-I submissions for• consistency, and visual inspections are conducted to prevent rule violations.• Model Alignment: Participants receive ground truth 3D models and a script to compute thefinal Chamfer distance. They must align their models with the ground truth and prepare atransformation matrix for each submitted object. The final Chamfer distance is calculatedusing these models and matrices.• Chamfer Distance Calculation: Shape accuracy is assessed using the Chamfer distanceX Ymetric. Given two point sets and , the Chamfer distance is defined as:1 1(cid:88) (cid:88)2 2d (X, Y ) = min ∥x − y∥ + min ∥x − y∥ (2)CD 2 2|X| |Y |y∈Y x∈Xx∈X y∈YThis metric offers a comprehensive measure of similarity between the reconstructed 3D models andthe ground truth. The final ranking is determined by combining scores from both Phase-I (volumeaccuracy) and Phase-II (shape accuracy). Note that after the Phase-I evaluation, quality issues werefound with the data for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget), so these items were excludedfrom the final overall evaluation.4 First Place Team - VolETA4.1 MethodologyThe team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculateprecise food volumes.4.1.1 OverviewThe team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volumefrom RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptualhashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neuralsurface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, includingisolated piece removal and scaling factor adjustments, enhance accuracy. This approach provides athorough solution for accurate food volume assessment, with potential uses in nutrition analysis.4.1.2 The Team’s Proposal: VolETAThe team starts by acquiring input data, specifically RGBD images and corresponding food objectnI = {I } nmasks. The RGBD images, denoted as , where is the total number of frames,D Di i=1 f n{M }provide depth information alongside RGB images. The food object masks, , help identifyi=1iregions of interest within these images. n K k n{I } {I } ⊆ {I }Next, the team selects keyframes. From the set , keyframes areDi Dii=1 j j=1 i=1chosen. A method is implemented to detect and remove duplicate and blurry images, ensuringhigh-quality frames. This involves applying a Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fouriertransform method. Near-Image Similarity uses perceptual hashing and Hamming distance threshold-ing to detect similar images and retain overlapping ones. Duplicates and blurry images are excludedto maintain data integrity and accuracy.K k{I }Using the selected keyframes , the team estimates camera poses through a method calledj j=1PixSfM, which involves extracting features using SuperPoint, matching them with SuperGlue, andk{C }refining them. The outputs are the camera poses , crucial for understanding the scene’sj j=1spatial layout. 4In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segmentsRMthe reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask for eachkeyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ methodRMextends the reference object mask to all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference objectR n{M }masks . This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.i i=1 R n{M }To create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks , andi i=1F n R n{M } {I }food object masks . This step, denoted as , integrates various data sources into ai i=1 i i=1unified format for further processing. R n k{I } {C }The team converts the RGBA images and camera poses into meaningful metadataji i=1 j=1Dand modeled data . This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.mDThe modeled data is input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshesmf r{R , R } for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations. The team uses the""Remove Isolated Pieces"" technique to refine the meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one fooditem, the diameter threshold is set to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connectedf r{RC , RC }components with diameters less than or equal to 5%, resulting in a cleaned mesh . Thisstep ensures that only significant parts of the mesh are retained.SThe team manually identifies an initial scaling factor using the reference mesh via MeshLab. ThisSfactor is fine-tuned to using depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accuratef Sscaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor is applied to theff fRC RFcleaned food mesh , producing the final scaled food mesh . This step culminates in anaccurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation.4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factorGenerally, 3D reconstruction methods produce unitless meshes by default. To address this, the teammanually determines the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block of the referencelobject mesh. The average of all block lengths is calculated, while the actual real-world length isavgl = 0.012 S = l /lconstant at meters. The scaling factor is applied to the clean food meshreal real avgf fRC RF, resulting in the final scaled food mesh in meters.The team uses depth information along with food and reference object masks to validate the scalingfactors. The method for assessing food size involves using overhead RGB images for each scene.Initially, the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) is determined using the reference object. Subse-f fquently, the food width ( ) and length ( ) are extracted using a food object mask. To determine thew lffood height ( ), a two-step process is followed. First, binary image segmentation is performed usinghthe overhead depth and reference images, yielding a segmented depth image for the reference object.dThe average depth is then calculated using the segmented reference object depth ( ). Similarly,remploying binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, thed faverage depth for the segmented food depth image ( ) is computed. The estimated food height isf hd d Sthe absolute difference between and . To assess the accuracy of the scaling factor , the foodr f(f × f × f ) × P P Ubounding box volume is computed. The team evaluates if the scaling factorw l hS Sgenerates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in . Table 2 lists the scalingfinefactors, PPU, 2D reference object dimensions, 3D food object dimensions, and potential volume.For one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team uses One-2-3-45 to reconstruct a 3D model from a singleRGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation to both food RGB and mask images.SIsolated pieces are removed from the generated mesh, and the scaling factor , which is closer to thepotential volume of the clean mesh, is reused.4.2 Experimental Results4.2.1 Implementation settingsExperiments were conducted using two GPUs: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/12G and RTX 3060/6G. TheHamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbersin the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieceswas set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube""aabb scale"" of 1, ""scale"" of 0.15, and ""offset"" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.54.2.2 VolETA ResultsThe team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their resultswith ground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. The team’s approach wasapplied separately to each food scene. A one-shot food volume estimation approach was used ifkthe number of keyframes equaled 1; otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation was applied.Notably, the keyframe selection process chose 34.8% of the total frames for the rest of the pipeline,showing the minimum frames with the highest information.Table 2: List of Extracted Information Using RGBD and MasksS R × R (f × f × f )Level Id Label PPUf w l w l h320 × 360 (238 × 257 × 2.353)1 Strawberry 0.08955223881 0.01786 236 × 274 (363 × 419 × 2.353)2 Cinnamon bun 0.1043478261 0.02347 246 × 270 (435 × 778 × 1.176)3 Pork rib 0.1043478261 0.02381 291 × 339 (262 × 976 × 2.353)Easy 4 Corn 0.08823529412 0.01897 266 × 292 (530 × 581 × 2.53)5 French toast 0.1034482759 0.02202 230 × 265 (294 × 431 × 2.353)6 Sandwich 0.1276595745 0.02426 208 × 264 (378 × 400 × 2.353)7 Burger 0.1043478261 0.02435 256 × 300 (298 × 310 × 4.706)8 Cake 0.1276595745 0.02143 291 × 357 (441 × 443 × 2.353)9 Blueberry muffin 0.08759124088 0.01801 315 × 377 (446 × 857 × 1.176)10 Banana 0.08759124088 0.01705 242 × 269 (201 × 303 × 1.176)Medium 11 Salmon 0.1043478261 0.02390 244 × 271 (251 × 917 × 2.353)13 Burrito 0.1034482759 0.02372 266 × 304 (400 × 1022 × 2.353)14 Frankfurt sandwich 0.1034482759 0.02115 306 × 368 (458 × 134 × 1.176)16 Everything bagel 0.08759124088 0.01747 319 × 367 (395 × 695 × 2.176)Hard 17 Croissant 0.1276595745 0.01751 249 × 318 (186 × 95 × 0.987)18 Shrimp 0.08759124088 0.02021 294 × 338 (465 × 537 × 0.8)19 Waffle 0.01034482759 0.01902 292 × 336 (442 × 651 × 1.176)20 Pizza 0.01034482759 0.01913After finding keyframes, PixSfM estimated the poses and point cloud. After generating scaled meshes,the team calculated volumes and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics. Mesheswere registered with ground truth meshes using ICP to obtain transformation metrics.Table 3 presents quantitative comparisons of the team’s volumes and Chamfer distance with andwithout estimated transformation metrics from ICP. For overall method performance, Table 4 showsthe MAPE and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics.Additionally, qualitative results on one- and few-shot 3D reconstruction from the challenge datasetare shown. The model excels in texture details, artifact correction, missing data handling, and coloradjustment across different scene parts.Limitations: Despite promising results, several limitations need to be addressed in future work:• Manual processes: The current pipeline includes manual steps like providing segmentationprompts and identifying scaling factors, which should be automated to enhance efficiency.• Input requirements: The method requires extensive input information, including foodmasks and depth data. Streamlining these inputs would simplify the process and increaseapplicability.• Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments withcomplex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.• Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturingcomplexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.• Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improveefficiency. 6Table 3: Quantitative Comparison with Ground Truth Using Chamfer DistanceL Id Team’s Vol. GT Vol. Ch. w/ t.m Ch. w/o t.m1 40.06 38.53 1.63 85.402 216.9 280.36 7.12 111.473 278.86 249.67 13.69 172.88E 4 279.02 295.13 2.03 61.305 395.76 392.58 13.67 102.146 205.17 218.44 6.68 150.787 372.93 368.77 4.70 66.918 186.62 173.13 2.98 152.349 224.08 232.74 3.91 160.0710 153.76 163.09 2.67 138.45M 11 80.4 85.18 3.37 151.1413 363.99 308.28 5.18 147.5314 535.44 589.83 4.31 89.6616 163.13 262.15 18.06 28.33H 17 224.08 181.36 9.44 28.9418 25.4 20.58 4.28 12.8419 110.05 108.35 11.34 23.9820 130.96 119.83 15.59 31.05Table 4: Quantitative Comparison with Ground Truth Using MAPE and Chamfer DistanceMAPE Ch. w/ t.m Ch. w/o t.m(%) sum mean sum mean10.973 0.130 0.007 1.715 0.0955 Second Place Team - ININ-VIAUN5.1 MethodologyThis section details the team’s proposed network, illustrating the step-by-step process from originalimages to final mesh models.5.1.1 Scale factor estimationThe procedure for estimating the scale factor at the coordinate level is illustrated in Figure 9. Theteam adheres to a method involving corner projection matching. Specifically, utilizing the COLMAPdense model, the team acquires the pose of each image along with dense point cloud data. For anyimg [R|t]given image and its extrinsic parameters , the team initially performs threshold-basedk kcorner detection, setting the threshold at 240. This step allows them to obtain the pixel coordinateskof all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters and the extrinsic parameters[R|t] , the point cloud is projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of thek kP icorners, the team can identify the closest point coordinates for each corner, where represents theiindex of the corner. Thus, they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows:k k k 2D = (P − P ) ∀i ̸= j (3)ij i j kTo determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image , the team takes thek kD dminimum value of each row of the matrix (excluding the diagonal) to form the vector . Themedian of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by Equation 4, where0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm):0.012=scale (4)(cid:80)n kmed(d )i=175.1.2 3D ReconstructionThe 3D reconstruction process, depicted in Figure 10, involves two different pipelines to accommodatevariations in input viewpoints. The first fifteen objects are processed using one pipeline, while thelast five single-view objects are processed using another.For the initial fifteen objects, the team uses COLMAP to estimate poses and segment the food usingthe provided segment masks. Advanced multi-view 3D reconstruction methods are then applied toreconstruct the segmented food. The team employs three different reconstruction methods: COLMAP,DiffusioNeRF, and NeRF2Mesh. They select the best reconstruction results from these methods andextract the mesh. The extracted mesh is scaled using the estimated scale factor, and optimizationtechniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh.For the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstructionmethods, including Zero123, Zero123++, One2345, ZeroNVS, and DreamGaussian. They chooseZeroNVS to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. Theintrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object are used, and an optimization method basedon reprojection error refines the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. Due to limitations insingle-view reconstruction, depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocularimage are used to determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, optimization techniques areapplied to obtain a refined mesh.5.1.3 Mesh refinementDuring the 3D Reconstruction phase, it was observed that the model’s results often suffered from lowquality due to holes on the object’s surface and substantial noise, as shown in Figure 11.To address the holes, MeshFix, an optimization method based on computational geometry, is em-ployed. For surface noise, Laplacian Smoothing is used for mesh smoothing operations. TheLaplacian Smoothing method adjusts the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboringvertices:  1 (cid:88) (old) (old)(new) (old) V − VV = V + λ (5) j ii i |N (i)| j∈N(i)λIn their implementation, the smoothing factor is set to 0.2, and 10 iterations are performed.5.2 Experimental Results5.2.1 Estimated scale factorThe scale factors estimated using the described method are shown in Table 5. Each image and thecorresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average scalefactor for each object.5.2.2 Reconstructed meshesThe refined meshes obtained using the described methods are shown in Figure 12. The predictedmodel volumes, ground truth model volumes, and the percentage errors between them are presentedin Table 6.5.2.3 AlignmentThe team designs a multi-stage alignment method for evaluating reconstruction quality. Figure 13illustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the central points of both the predicted andground truth models are calculated, and the predicted model is moved to align with the central pointof the ground truth model. Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantlyreducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtainthe final transformation matrix.The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.8Table 5: Estimated Scale FactorsObject Index Food Item Scale Factor1 Strawberry 0.0600582 Cinnamon bun 0.0818293 Pork rib 0.0738614 Corn 0.0835945 French toast 0.0786326 Sandwich 0.0883687 Burger 0.1031248 Cake 0.0684969 Blueberry muffin 0.05929210 Banana 0.05823611 Salmon 0.08382113 Burrito 0.06966314 Hotdog 0.073766Table 6: Metric of VolumeObject Index Predicted Volume Ground Truth Error Percentage1 44.51 38.53 15.522 321.26 280.36 14.593 336.11 249.67 34.624 347.54 295.13 17.765 389.28 392.58 0.846 197.82 218.44 9.447 412.52 368.77 11.868 181.21 173.13 4.679 233.79 232.74 0.4510 160.06 163.09 1.8611 86.0 85.18 0.9613 334.7 308.28 8.5714 517.75 589.83 12.2216 176.24 262.15 32.7717 180.68 181.36 0.3718 13.58 20.58 34.0119 117.72 108.35 8.6420 117.43 119.83 20.036 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle6.1 MethodologyTo achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines asdepicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-motion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,a sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve meshquality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques tofacilitate model generation.6.1.1 Multi-View ReconstructionFor Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integratingSuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limitedkeypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.In the mesh reconstruction phase, the team’s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, whichemploys a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion9and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized toproduce a dense point cloud.During post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outlineof the supporting surface, and projected the lower mesh vertices onto this surface. They utilizedthe reconstructed checkerboard to correct the model’s scale and employed Poisson reconstruction tocreate a complete, watertight mesh of the subject.6.1.2 Single-View ReconstructionFor 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team utilized advanced methods such as LGM, InstantMesh, and One-2-3-45 to generate an initial mesh. This initial mesh was then refined in conjunctionwith depth structure information.To adjust the scale, the team estimated the object’s length using the checkerboard as a reference,assuming that the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3Dobject back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.6.2 Experimental ResultsThrough a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation thatminimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimizationaimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completionof this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objectsamounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores forboth multi- view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.Table 7: Total Errors for Different Teams on Multi-view and Single-view DataTeam Multi-view (1-14) Single-view (16-20)FoodRiddle 0.036362 0.019232ININ-VIAUN 0.041552 0.027889VolETA 0.071921 0.0587267 ConclusionThis report examines and compiles the techniques and findings from the MetaFood Workshopchallenge on 3D Food Reconstruction.

R008,"Advanced techniques for through and contextuallyInterpreting Noun-Noun CompoundsAbstractThis study examines the effectiveness of transfer learning and multi-task learningin the context of a complex semantic classification problem: understanding themeaning of noun-noun compounds. Through a series of detailed experiments andan in-depth analysis of errors, we demonstrate that employing transfer learning byinitializing parameters and multi-task learning through parameter sharing enables aneural classification model to better generalize across a dataset characterized by ahighly uneven distribution of semantic relationships. Furthermore, we illustratehow utilizing dual annotations, which involve two distinct sets of relations appliedto the same compounds, can enhance the overall precision of a neural classifier andimprove its F1 scores for less common yet more challenging semantic relations.1 IntroductionNoun-noun compound interpretation involves determining the semantic connection between twonouns (or noun phrases in multi-word compounds). For instance, in the compound ""street protest,""the task is to identify the semantic relationship between ""street"" and ""protest,"" which is a locativerelation in this example. Given the prevalence of noun-noun compounds in natural language and itssignificance to other natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question answering and informationretrieval, understanding noun-noun compounds has been extensively studied in theoretical linguistics,psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics.In computational linguistics, noun-noun compound interpretation is typically treated as an automaticclassification task. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms and models, such as MaximumEntropy, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, have been employed to decipher thesemantics of nominal compounds. These models utilize information from lexical semantics, likeWordNet-based features, and distributional semantics, such as word embeddings. However, noun-noun compound interpretation remains a challenging NLP problem due to the high productivityof noun-noun compounding as a linguistic structure and the difficulty in deriving the semantics ofnoun-noun compounds from their constituents. Our research contributes to advancing NLP researchon noun-noun compound interpretation through the application of transfer and multi-task learning.The application of transfer learning (TL) and multi-task learning (MTL) in NLP has gained significantattention in recent years, yielding varying outcomes based on the specific tasks, model architectures,and datasets involved. These varying results, combined with the fact that neither TL nor MTL hasbeen previously applied to noun-noun compound interpretation, motivate our thorough empiricalinvestigation into the use of TL and MTL for this task. Our aim is not only to add to the existingresearch on the effectiveness of TL and MTL for semantic NLP tasks generally but also to ascertaintheir specific advantages for compound interpretation.A key reason for utilizing multi-task learning is to enhance generalization by making use of thedomain-specific details present in the training data of related tasks. In this study, we demonstrate thatTL and MTL can serve as a form of regularization, enabling the prediction of infrequent relationswithin a dataset marked by a highly skewed distribution of relations. This dataset is particularlywell-suited for TL and MTL experimentation, as elaborated in Section 3.Our contributions are summarized as follows:1. Through meticulous analysis of results, we discover that TL and MTL, especially when appliedto the embedding layer, enhance overall accuracy and F1 scores for less frequent relations in ahighly skewed dataset, compared to a robust single-task learning baseline. 2. Although our researchconcentrates on TL and MTL, we present, to our knowledge, the first experimental results on therelatively recent dataset from Fares (2016).2 Related WorkApproaches to interpreting noun-noun compounds differ based on the classification of compoundrelations, as well as the machine learning models and features employed to learn these relations. Forinstance, some define a broad set of relations, while others employ a more detailed classification.Some researchers challenge the idea that noun-noun compounds can be interpreted using a fixed,predetermined set of relations, proposing alternative methods based on paraphrasing. We centerour attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving afixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to thistask, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropymodels that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks thatrely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previouslyapplied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in otherNLP tasks.Several recent studies have conducted extensive experiments on the application of TL and MTL to avariety of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, semantic labeling, sentence-level sentimentclassification, super-tagging, chunking, and semantic dependency parsing. The consensus amongthese studies is that the advantages of TL and MTL are largely contingent on the characteristics of thetasks involved, including the unevenness of the data distribution, the semantic relatedness betweenthe source and target tasks, the learning trajectory of the auxiliary and main tasks (where target tasksthat quickly reach a plateau benefit most from non-plateauing auxiliary tasks), and the structuralsimilarity between the tasks. Besides differing in the NLP tasks they investigate, the aforementionedstudies employ slightly varied definitions of TL and MTL. Our research aligns with certain studies inthat we apply TL and MTL to learn different semantic annotations of noun-noun compounds usingthe same dataset. However, our experimental design is more akin to other work in that we experimentwith initializing parameters across all layers of the neural network and concurrently train a singleMTL model on two sets of relations.3 Task Definition and DatasetThe objective of this task is to train a model to categorize the semantic relationships between pairsof nouns in a labeled dataset, where each pair forms a noun-noun compound. The complexity ofthis task is influenced by factors such as the label set used and its distribution. For the experimentsdetailed in this paper, we utilize a noun-noun compounds dataset that features compounds annotatedwith two distinct taxonomies of relations. This means that each noun-noun compound is associatedwith two different relations, each based on different linguistic theories. This dataset is derived fromestablished linguistic resources, including NomBank and the Prague Czech-English DependencyTreebank 2.0 (PCEDT). We chose this dataset for two primary reasons: firstly, the dual annotation ofrelations on the same set of compounds is ideal for exploring TL and MTL approaches; secondly,aligning two different annotation frameworks on the same data allows for a comparative analysisacross these frameworks.Specifically, we use a portion of the dataset, focusing on type-based instances of two-word compounds.The original dataset also encompasses multi-word compounds (those made up of more than twonouns) and multiple instances per compound type. We further divide the dataset into three parts:training, development, and test sets. Table 1 details the number of compound types and the vocabularysize for each set, including a breakdown of words appearing in the right-most (right constituents)and left-most (left constituents) positions. The two label sets consist of 35 PCEDT functors and 182NomBank argument and adjunct relations. As discussed in Section 7.1, these label sets have a highlyuneven distribution.Table 1: Characteristics of the noun-noun compound dataset used in our experiments. The numbersin this table correspond to a subset of the dataset, see Section 3.Train Dev TestCompounds 6932 920 1759Vocab size 4102 1163 1772Right constituents 2304 624 969Left constituents 2405 618 985Many relations in PCEDT and NomBank conceptually describe similar semantic ideas, as they areused to annotate the semantics of the same text. For instance, the temporal and locative relations inNomBank (ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC, respectively) and their PCEDT counterparts (TWHENand LOC) exhibit relatively consistent behavior across frameworks, as they annotate many of thesame compounds. However, some relations that are theoretically similar do not align well in practice.For example, the functor AIM in PCEDT and the modifier argument ARGM-PNC in NomBankexpress a somewhat related semantic concept (purpose), but there is minimal overlap between thesets of compounds they annotate. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the semantic similarityin the label sets, where it exists, can be leveraged through transfer and multi-task learning, especiallysince the overall distribution of relations differs between the two frameworks.4 Transfer vs. Multi-Task LearningIn this section, we employ the terminology and definitions established by Pan and Yang (2010) toarticulate our framework for transfer and multi-task learning. Our classification task can be describedin terms of all training pairs (X, Y) and a probability distribution P(X), where X represents the inputfeature space, Y denotes the set of all labels, and N is the training data size. The domain of a task isdefined by X, P(X). Our goal is to learn a function f(X) that predicts Y based on the input features X.Considering two ML tasks, Ta and Tb, we would train two distinct models to learn separate functionsfa and fb for predicting Ya and Yb in a single-task learning scenario. However, if Ta and Tb arerelated, either explicitly or implicitly, TL and MTL can enhance the generalization of either or bothtasks. Two tasks are deemed related when their domains are similar but their label sets differ, or whentheir domains are dissimilar but their label sets are identical. Consequently, noun-noun compoundinterpretation using the dataset is well-suited for TL and MTL, as the training examples are identical,but the label sets are distinct.For clarity, we differentiate between transfer learning and multi-task learning in this paper, despitethese terms sometimes being used interchangeably in the literature. We define TL as the utilization ofparameters from a model trained on Ta to initialize another model for Tb. In contrast, MTL involvestraining parts of the same model to learn both Ta and Tb, essentially learning one set of parametersfor both tasks. The concept is to train a single model simultaneously on both tasks, where one taskintroduces an inductive bias that aids the model in generalizing over the main task. It is important tonote that this does not necessarily imply that we aim to use a single model to predict both label setsin practice.5 Neural Classification ModelsThis section introduces the neural classification models utilized in our experiments. To discern theimpact of TL and MTL, we initially present a single-task learning model, which acts as our baseline.Subsequently, we employ this same model to implement TL and MTL.5.1 Single-Task Learning ModelIn our single-task learning (STL) configuration, we train and fine-tune a feed-forward neural networkinspired by the neural classifier proposed by Dima and Hinrichs (2015). This network comprises fourlayers: 1) an input layer, 2) an embedding layer, 3) a hidden layer, and 4) an output layer. The input3layer consists of two integers that indicate the indices of a compound’s constituents in the embeddinglayer, where the word embedding vectors are stored. These selected vectors are then passed to a fullyconnected hidden layer, the size of which matches the dimensionality of the word embedding vectors.Finally, a softmax function is applied to the output layer to select the most probable relation.The compound’s constituents are represented using a 300-dimensional word embedding model trainedon an English Wikipedia dump and the English Gigaword Fifth Edition. The embedding model wastrained by Fares et al. (2017). If a word is not found during lookup in the embedding model, wecheck if the word is uppercased and attempt to find the lowercase version. For hyphenated wordsnot found in the embedding vocabulary, we split the word at the hyphen and average the vectors ofits parts, if they are present in the vocabulary. If the word remains unrepresented after these steps, adesignated vector for unknown words is employed.5.1.1 Architecture and HyperparametersOur selection of hyperparameters is informed by multiple rounds of experimentation with the single-task learning model, as well as the choices made by prior work. The weights of the embedding layerare updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employedis the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is cappedat 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the model’s accuracy on the validation split is alsoimplemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over fiveconsecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TLand MTL models are trained using the same hyperparameters as the STL model.5.2 Transfer Learning ModelsIn our experiments, transfer learning involves training an STL model on PCEDT relations and thenusing some of its weights to initialize another model for NomBank relations. Given the neuralclassifier architecture detailed in Section 5.1, we identify three ways to implement TL: 1) TLE:Transferring the embedding layer weights, 2) TLH: Transferring the hidden layer weights, and 3)TLEH: Transferring both the embedding and hidden layer weights. Furthermore, we differentiatebetween transfer learning from PCEDT to NomBank and vice versa. This results in six setups,as shown in Table 2. We do not apply TL (or MTL) to the output layer because it is task- ordataset-specific.5.3 Multi-Task Learning ModelsIn MTL, we train a single model to simultaneously learn both PCEDT and NomBank relations,meaning all MTL models have two objective functions and two output layers. We implement twoMTL setups: MTLE, which features a shared embedding layer but two task-specific hidden layers,and MTLF, which has no task-specific layers aside from the output layer (i.e., both the embeddingand hidden layers are shared). We distinguish between the auxiliary and main tasks based on whichvalidation accuracy (NomBank’s or PCEDT’s) is monitored by the early stopping criterion. Thisleads to a total of four MTL models, as shown in Table 3.6 Experimental ResultsTables 2 and 3 display the accuracies of the various TL and MTL models on the development and testsplits for NomBank and PCEDT. The top row in both tables indicates the accuracy of the STL model.All models were trained solely on the training split. Several insights can be gleaned from thesetables. Firstly, the accuracy of the STL models decreases when evaluated on the test split for bothNomBank and PCEDT. Secondly, all TL models achieve improved accuracy on the NomBank testsplit, although transfer learning does not significantly enhance accuracy on the development split ofthe same dataset. The MTL models, especially MTLF, have a detrimental effect on the developmentaccuracy of NomBank, yet we observe a similar improvement, as with TL, on the test split. Thirdly,both TL and MTL models demonstrate less consistent effects on PCEDT (on both development andtest splits) compared to NomBank. For instance, all TL models yield an absolute improvement of4about 1.25 points in accuracy on NomBank, whereas in PCEDT, TLE clearly outperforms the othertwo TL models (TLE improves over the STL accuracy by 1.37 points).Table 2: Accuracy (%) of the transfer learning models.Model NomBank PCEDTDev Test Dev TestSTL 78.15 76.75 58.80 56.05TLE 78.37 78.05 59.57 57.42TLH 78.15 78.00 59.24 56.51TLEH 78.48 78.00 59.89 56.68Table 3: Accuracy (%) of the MTL models.Model NomBank PCEDTDev Test Dev TestSTL 78.15 76.75 58.80 56.05MTLE 77.93 78.45 59.89 56.96MTLF 76.74 78.51 58.91 56.00Overall, the STL models’ accuracy declines when tested on the NomBank and PCEDT test splits,compared to their performance on the development split. This could suggest overfitting, especiallysince our stopping criterion selects the model with the best performance on the development split.Conversely, TL and MTL enhance accuracy on the test splits, despite using the same stopping criterionas STL. We interpret this as an improvement in the models’ ability to generalize. However, sincethese improvements are relatively minor, we further analyze the results to understand if and how TLand MTL are beneficial.7 Results AnalysisThis section provides a detailed analysis of the models’ performance, drawing on insights from thedataset and the classification errors made by the models. The discussion in the following sections isprimarily based on the results from the test split, as it is larger than the development split.7.1 Relation DistributionTo illustrate the complexity of the task, we depict the distribution of the most frequent relations inNomBank and PCEDT across the three data splits in Figure 1. Notably, approximately 71.18% of therelations in the NomBank training split are of type ARG1 (prototypical patient), while 52.20% of thePCEDT relations are of type RSTR (an underspecified adnominal modifier). Such a highly skeweddistribution makes learning some of the other relations more challenging, if not impossible in certaincases. In fact, out of the 15 NomBank relations observed in the test split, five are never predictedby any of the STL, TL, or MTL models. Similarly, of the 26 PCEDT relations in the test split, onlysix are predicted. However, the unpredicted relations are extremely rare in the training split (e.g., 23PCEDT functors appear less than 20 times), making it doubtful whether any ML model could learnthem under any circumstances.Given this imbalanced distribution, it is evident that accuracy alone is insufficient to determine thebest-performing model. Therefore, in the subsequent section, we report and analyze the F1 scores ofthe predicted NomBank and PCEDT relations across all STL, TL, and MTL models.7.2 Per-Relation F1 ScoresTables 4 and 5 present the per-relation F1 scores for NomBank and PCEDT, respectively. We onlyinclude results for relations that are actually predicted by at least one of the models.5Table 4: Per-label F1 score on the NomBank test split.A0 A1 A2 A3 LOC MNR TMPCount 132 1282 153 75 25 25 27STL 49.82 87.54 45.78 60.81 28.57 29.41 66.67TLE 55.02 87.98 41.61 60.14 27.91 33.33 63.83TLH 54.81 87.93 42.51 60.00 25.00 35.29 65.31TLEH 53.62 87.95 42.70 61.11 29.27 33.33 65.22MTLE 54.07 88.34 42.86 61.97 30.00 28.57 66.67MTLF 53.09 88.41 38.14 62.69 00.00 00.00 52.17Table 5: Per-label F1 score on the PCEDT test split.ACT TWHEN APP PAT REG RSTRCount 89 14 118 326 216 900STL 43.90 42.11 22.78 42.83 20.51 68.81TLE 49.37 70.97 27.67 41.60 30.77 69.67TLH 53.99 62.07 25.00 43.01 26.09 68.99TLEH 49.08 64.52 28.57 42.91 28.57 69.08MTLE 54.09 66.67 24.05 42.03 27.21 69.31MTLF 47.80 42.11 25.64 40.73 19.22 68.89Several noteworthy patterns emerge from Tables 4 and 5. Firstly, the MTLF model appears to bedetrimental to both datasets, leading to significantly degraded F1 scores for four NomBank relations,including the locative modifier ARGM-LOC and the manner modifier ARGM-MNR (abbreviated asLOC and MNR in Table 4), which the model fails to predict altogether. This same model exhibitsthe lowest F1 score compared to all other models for two PCEDT relations: REG (expressing acircumstance) and PAT (patient). Considering that the MTLF model achieves the highest accuracyon the NomBank test split (as shown in Table 3), it becomes even more apparent that relying solelyon accuracy scores is inadequate for evaluating the effectiveness of TL and MTL for this task anddataset.Secondly, with the exception of the MTLF model, all TL and MTL models consistently improvethe F1 score for all PCEDT relations except PAT. Notably, the F1 scores for the relations TWHENand ACT show a substantial increase compared to other PCEDT relations when only the embeddinglayer’s weights are shared (MTLE) or transferred (TLE). This outcome can be partially understoodby examining the correspondence matrices between NomBank arguments and PCEDT functors,presented in Tables 7 and 6. These tables illustrate how PCEDT functors map to NomBank argumentsin the training split (Table 6) and vice versa (Table 7). Table 6 reveals that 80% of the compoundsannotated as TWHEN in PCEDT were annotated as ARGM-TMP in NomBank. Additionally, 47% ofACT (Actor) relations map to ARG0 (Proto-Agent) in NomBank. While this mapping is not as distinctas one might hope, it is still relatively high when compared to how other PCEDT relations map toARG0. The correspondence matrices also demonstrate that the presumed theoretical similaritiesbetween NomBank and PCEDT relations do not always hold in practice. Nevertheless, even suchimperfect correspondences can provide a training signal that assists the TL and MTL models inlearning relations like TWHEN and ACT.Since the TLE model outperforms STL in predicting REG by ten absolute points, we examinedall REG compounds correctly classified by TLE but misclassified by STL. We found that STLmisclassified them as RSTR, indicating that TL from NomBank helps TLE recover from STL’sovergeneralization in RSTR prediction.The two NomBank relations that receive the highest boost in F1 score (about five absolute points)are ARG0 and ARGM-MNR, but the improvement in the latter corresponds to only one additionalcompound, which might be a chance occurrence. Overall, TL and MTL from NomBank to PCEDTare more helpful than the reverse. One explanation is that five PCEDT relations (including the fourmost frequent ones) map to ARG1 in NomBank in more than 60% of cases for each relation, as seenin the first rows of Tables 6 and 7. This suggests that the weights learned to predict PCEDT relations6Table 6: Correspondence matrix between PCEDT functors and NomBank arguments.

Conversely, the mapping from NomBank toPCEDT shows that although many NomBank arguments map to RSTR in PCEDT, the percentagesare lower, making the mapping more diverse and discriminative, which seems to aid TL and MTLmodels in learning less frequent PCEDT relations.To understand why the PCEDT functor AIM is never predicted despite being more frequent thanTWHEN, we found that AIM is almost always misclassified as RSTR by all models. Furthermore,AIM and RSTR have the highest lexical overlap in the training set among all PCEDT relation pairs:78.35% of left constituents and 73.26% of right constituents of compounds annotated as AIM occurin other compounds annotated as RSTR. This explains the models’ inability to learn AIM but raisesquestions about their ability to learn relational representations, which we explore further in Section7.3. Table 8: Macro-average F1 score on the test split.Model NomBank PCEDTSTL 52.66 40.15TLE 52.83 48.34TLH 52.98 46.52TLEH 53.31 47.12MTLE 53.21 47.23MTLF 42.07 40.73Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of TL and MTL for NomBank and PCEDT, we report the F1macro-average scores in Table 8. This is arguably the appropriate evaluation measure for imbalancedclassification problems. Note that relations not predicted by any model are excluded from the macro-average calculation. Table 8 clearly shows that TL and MTL on the embedding layer yield significantimprovements for PCEDT, with about a 7-8 point increase in macro-average F1, compared to just0.65 in the best case for NomBank. 77.3 Generalization on Unseen CompoundsWe now analyze the models’ ability to generalize to compounds not seen during training. Recentresearch suggests that gains in noun-noun compound interpretation using word embeddings andsimilar neural classification models might be due to lexical memorization. In other words, the modelslearn that specific nouns are strong indicators of specific relations. To assess the role of lexicalmemorization in our models, we quantify the number of unseen compounds that the STL, TL, andMTL models predict correctly.We differentiate between ’partly’ and ’completely’ unseen compounds. A compound is ’partly’unseen if one of its constituents (left or right) is not present in the training data. A ’completely’unseen compound is one where neither the left nor the right constituent appears in the training data.Overall, nearly 20% of the compounds in the test split have an unseen left constituent, about 16%have an unseen right constituent, and 4% are completely unseen. Table 9 compares the performanceof the different models on these three groups in terms of the proportion of compounds misclassifiedin each group.Table 9: Generalization error on the subset of unseen compounds in the test split. L: Left constituent.R: Right constituent. L&R: Completely unseen.NomBank PCEDTModel L R L&R L R L&RCount 351 286 72 351 286 72STL 27.92 39.51 50.00 45.01 47.55 41.67TLE 25.93 36.71 48.61 43.87 47.55 41.67TLH 26.21 38.11 50.00 46.15 49.30 47.22TLEH 26.50 38.81 52.78 45.87 47.55 43.06MTLE 24.50 33.22 38.89 44.44 47.20 43.06MTLF 22.79 34.27 40.28 44.16 47.90 38.89Table 9 shows that Transfer Learning (TL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approaches reducegeneralization error in NomBank across all scenarios, with the exception of TLH and TLEH forcompletely unseen compounds, where error increases. The greatest error reductions are achievedby MTL models across all three types of unseen compounds. Specifically, MTLE reduces the errorby approximately six points for compounds with unseen right constituents and by eleven points forfully unseen compounds. Moreover, MTLF reduces the error by five points when the left constituentis unseen. It’s important to interpret these results in conjunction with the Count row in Table 9 fora comprehensive view. For example, the eleven-point error decrease in fully unseen compoundsrepresents eight compounds. In PCEDT, the largest error reduction is on unseen left constituents,which is about 1.14 points, corresponding to four compounds; it’s 0.35 on unseen right constituents(one compound) and 2.7 on fully unseen compounds, or two compounds.Upon manual inspection of compounds that led to substantial reductions in the generalization error,specifically within NomBank, we examined the distribution of relations within correctly predictedunseen compound sets. Compared to the STL model, MTLE reduces generalization error forcompletely unseen compounds by a total of eight compounds, of which seven are annotated with therelation ARG1, which is the most common in NomBank. Regarding the unseen right constituents,MTLE’s 24 improved compounds consist of 18 ARG1, 5 ARG0, and 1 ARG2 compounds. Asimilar pattern arises when examining TLE model improvements, where most gains come from betterpredictions of ARG1 and ARG0 relations.A large portion of unseen compounds, whether partly or entirely unseen, that were misclassified byevery model, were not of type ARG1 in NomBank, or RSTR in PCEDT. This pattern, along withcorrectly predicted unseen compounds primarily annotated with the most common relations, suggeststhat classification models rely on lexical memorization to learn the compound relation interpretation.To better comprehend lexical memorization’s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con-stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specificconstituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the trainingdata. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each8relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specificconstituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the modelsolely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN inPCEDT have distinctly high ratios compared to other relations in Figure 2. These relations alsohave the second-highest F1 score in their datasets—except for STL on PCEDT (see Tables 4 and5). Lexical memorization is therefore a likely cause of these high F1 scores. We also observed thatlower ratios of relation-specific constituents correlate with lower F1 scores, such as APP and REG inPCEDT. Based on these insights, we can’t dismiss the possibility that our models show some degreeof lexical memorization, despite manual analysis also presenting cases where models demonstrategeneralization and correct predictions in situations where lexical memorization is impossible.8 ConclusionThe application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular taskcharacteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL andMTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence ofminimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drasticallyenhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements areobserved on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present inthe training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our erroranalysis of unseen compounds.Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embeddinglayers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore,in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacityto generalize when it comes to less frequent relations.The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compoundinterpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling orsemantic dependency parsing in PCEDT and NomBank. Future research will focus on incorporatingadditional natural language processing tasks defined using these frameworks to understand noun-nouncompound interpretation using TL and MTL. 9",1,EMNLP
R009,"The Importance of Written Explanations inAggregating Crowdsourced PredictionsAbstractThis study demonstrates that incorporating the written explanations provided byindividuals when making predictions enhances the accuracy of aggregated crowd-sourced forecasts. The research shows that while majority and weighted votemethods are effective, the inclusion of written justifications improves forecastaccuracy throughout most of a question’s duration, with the exception of its finalphase. Furthermore, the study analyzes the attributes that differentiate reliable andunreliable justifications.1 IntroductionThe concept of the ""wisdom of the crowd"" posits that combining information from numerous non-expert individuals can produce answers that are as accurate as, or even more accurate than, thoseprovided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the medianestimate of an ox’s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actualweight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examplesdemonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was ableto defeat the combined moves of a crowd.In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipediarelies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms havegarnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information fromlarge groups, it is important to determine whether the individual inputs were made independently. Ifnot, factors like group psychology and the influence of persuasive arguments can skew individualjudgments, thus negating the positive effects of crowd wisdom.This paper focuses on forecasts concerning questions spanning political, economic, and socialdomains. Each forecast includes a prediction, estimating the probability of a particular event, anda written justification that explains the reasoning behind the prediction. Forecasts with identicalpredictions can have justifications of varying strength, which, in turn, affects the perceived reliabilityof the predictions. For instance, a justification that simply refers to an external source withoutexplanation may appear to rely heavily on the prevailing opinion of the crowd and might be consideredweaker than a justification that presents specific, verifiable facts from external resources.To clarify the terminology used: a ""question"" is defined as a statement that seeks information (e.g.,""Will new legislation be implemented before a certain date?""). Questions have a defined start andend date, and the period between these dates constitutes the ""life"" of the question. ""Forecasters""are individuals who provide a ""forecast,"" which consists of a ""prediction"" and a ""justification."" Theprediction is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring. The justificationis the text provided by the forecaster to support their prediction. The central problem addressed inthis work is termed ""calling a question,"" which refers to the process of determining a final predictionby aggregating individual forecasts. Two strategies are employed for calling questions each daythroughout their life: considering forecasts submitted on the given day (""daily"") and considering thelast forecast submitted by each forecaster (""active"").Inspired by prior research on recognizing and fostering skilled forecasters, and analyzing writtenjustifications to assess the quality of individual or collective forecasts, this paper investigates theautomated calling of questions throughout their duration based on the forecasts available each day.The primary contributions are empirical findings that address the following research questions:* When making a prediction on a specific day, is it advantageous to include forecasts from previousdays? (Yes) * Does the accuracy of the prediction improve when considering the question itselfand the written justifications provided with the forecasts? (Yes) * Is it easier to make an accurateprediction toward the end of a question’s duration? (Yes) * Are written justifications more valuablewhen the crowd’s predictions are less accurate? (Yes)In addition, this research presents an examination of the justifications associated with both accurateand inaccurate forecasts. This analysis aims to identify the features that contribute to a justificationbeing more or less credible.2 Related WorkThe language employed by individuals is indicative of various characteristics. Prior research includesboth predictive models (using language samples to predict attributes about the author) and modelsthat provide valuable insights (using language samples and author attributes to identify differentiatinglinguistic features). Previous studies have examined factors such as gender and age, political ideology,health outcomes, and personality traits. In this paper, models are constructed to predict outcomesbased on crowd-sourced forecasts without knowledge of individual forecasters’ identities.Previous research has also explored how language use varies depending on the relationships betweenindividuals. For instance, studies have analyzed language patterns in social networks, online commu-nities, and corporate emails to understand how individuals in positions of authority communicate.Similarly, researchers have examined how language provides insights into interpersonal interactionsand relationships. In terms of language form and function, prior research has investigated politeness,empathy, advice, condolences, usefulness, and deception. Related to the current study’s focus,researchers have examined the influence of Wikipedia editors and studied influence levels withinonline communities. Persuasion has also been analyzed from a computational perspective, includingwithin the context of dialogue systems. The work presented here complements these previous studies.The goal is to identify credible justifications to improve the aggregation of crowdsourced forecasts,without explicitly targeting any of the aforementioned characteristics.Within the field of computational linguistics, the task most closely related to this research is argumen-tation. A strong justification for a forecast can be considered a well-reasoned supporting argument.Previous work in this area includes identifying argument components such as claims, premises,backing, rebuttals, and refutations, as well as mining arguments that support or oppose a particularclaim. Despite these efforts, it was found that crowdsourced justifications rarely adhere to theseestablished argumentation frameworks, even though such justifications are valuable for aggregatingforecasts.Finally, several studies have focused on forecasting using datasets similar or identical to the one usedin this research. From a psychological perspective, researchers have explored strategies for enhancingforecasting accuracy, such as utilizing top-performing forecasters (often called ""superforecasters""),and have analyzed the traits that contribute to their success. These studies aim to identify and cultivatesuperforecasters but do not incorporate the written justifications accompanying forecasts. In contrast,the present research develops models to call questions without using any information about theforecasters themselves. Within the field of computational linguistics, researchers have evaluated thelanguage used in high-quality justifications, focusing on aspects like rating, benefit, and influence.Other researchers have developed models to predict forecaster skill using the textual justificationsfrom specific datasets, such as the Good Judgment Open data, and have also applied these modelsto predict the accuracy of individual forecasts in other contexts, such as company earnings reports.However, none of these prior works have specifically aimed to call questions throughout their entireduration. 23 DatasetThe research utilizes data from the Good Judgment Open, a platform where questions are posted, andindividuals submit their forecasts. The questions primarily revolve around geopolitics, encompassingareas such as domestic and international politics, the economy, and social matters. For this study, allbinary questions were collected, along with their associated forecasts, each comprising a predictionand a justification. In total, the dataset contains 441 questions and 96,664 forecasts submittedover 32,708 days. This dataset significantly expands upon previous research, nearly doubling thenumber of forecasts analyzed. Since the objective is to accurately call questions throughout theirentire duration, all forecasts with written justifications are included, regardless of factors such asjustification length or the number of forecasts submitted by a single forecaster. Additionally, thisapproach prioritizes privacy, as no information about the individual forecasters is utilized.Table 1: Analysis of the questions from our dataset. Most questions are relatively long, contain twoor more named entities, and are open for over one month.Metric Min Q1 Q2 (Median) Q3 Max Mean# tokens 8 16 20 28 48 21.94# entities 0 2 3 5 11 3.47# verbs 0 2 2 3 6 2.26# days open 2 24 59 98 475 74.16Table 1 provides a basic analysis of the questions in the dataset. The majority of questions arerelatively lengthy, containing more than 16 tokens and multiple named entities, with geopolitical,person, and date entities being the most frequent. In terms of duration, half of the questions remainopen for nearly two months, and 75% are open for more than three weeks.An examination of the topics covered by the questions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)reveals three primary themes: elections (including terms like ""voting,"" ""winners,"" and ""candidate""),government actions (including terms like ""negotiations,"" ""announcements,"" ""meetings,"" and ""passing(a law)""), and wars and violent crimes (including terms like ""groups,"" ""killing,"" ""civilian (casualties),""and ""arms""). Although not explicitly represented in the LDA topics, the questions address bothdomestic and international events within these broad themes.Table 2: Analysis of the 96,664 written justifications submitted by forecasters in our dataset. Thereadability scores indicate that most justifications are easily understood by high school students (11thor 12th grade), although a substantial amount (>25%) require a college education (Flesch under 50 orDale-Chall over 9.0).

The medianlength is relatively short, consisting of one sentence and 23 tokens. Justifications mention namedentities less frequently than the questions themselves. Interestingly, half of the justifications containat least one negation, and 25% include three or more. This suggests that forecasters sometimes basetheir predictions on events that might not occur or have not yet occurred. The sentiment polarity of3the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scoressuggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for fullcomprehension.Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most commonverb classes are ""change"" (e.g., ""happen,"" ""remain,"" ""increase""), ""social"" (e.g., ""vote,"" ""support,""""help""), ""cognition"" (e.g., ""think,"" ""believe,"" ""know""), and ""motion"" (e.g., ""go,"" ""come,"" ""leave"").The most frequent noun classes are ""act"" (e.g., ""election,"" ""support,"" ""deal""), ""communication"" (e.g.,""questions,"" ""forecast,"" ""news""), ""cognition"" (e.g., ""point,"" ""issue,"" ""possibility""), and ""group"" (e.g.,""government,"" ""people,"" ""party"").4 Experiments and ResultsExperiments are conducted to address the challenge of accurately calling a question throughoutits duration. The input consists of the question itself and the associated forecasts (predictions andjustifications), while the output is an aggregated answer to the question derived from all forecasts.The number of instances corresponds to the total number of days all questions were open. Bothsimple baselines and a neural network are employed, considering both (a) daily forecasts and (b)active forecasts submitted up to ten days prior.The questions are divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Subsequently, all forecastssubmitted throughout the duration of each question are assigned to their respective subsets. It’simportant to note that randomly splitting the forecasts would be an inappropriate approach. This isbecause forecasts for the same question submitted on different days would be distributed across thetraining, validation, and test subsets, leading to data leakage and inaccurate performance evaluation.4.1 BaselinesTwo unsupervised baselines are considered. The ""majority vote"" baseline determines the answer to aquestion based on the most frequent prediction among the forecasts. The ""weighted vote"" baseline,on the other hand, assigns weights to the probabilities in the predictions and then aggregates them.4.2 Neural Network ArchitectureA neural network architecture is employed, which consists of three main components: one to generatea representation of the question, another to generate a representation of each forecast, and an LSTMto process the sequence of forecasts and ultimately call the question.The representation of a question is obtained using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout. The representation of a forecast is created by concatenatingthree elements: (a) a binary flag indicating whether the forecast was submitted on the day the questionis being called or on a previous day, (b) the prediction itself (a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0),and (c) a representation of the justification. The representation of the justification is also obtainedusing BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout.The LSTM has a hidden state with a dimensionality of 256 and processes the sequence of forecastsas its input. During the tuning process, it was discovered that providing the representation of thequestion alongside each forecast is more effective than processing forecasts independently of thequestion. Consequently, the representation of the question is concatenated with the representation ofeach forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connectedto a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final predictionfor the question.4.3 Architecture AblationExperiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well aswith variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecastis manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information:4* Only the prediction. * The prediction and the representation of the question. * The prediction andthe representation of the justification. * The prediction, the representation of the question, and therepresentation of the justification.4.4 Quantitative ResultsThe evaluation metric used is accuracy, which represents the average percentage of days a modelcorrectly calls a question throughout its duration. Results are reported for all days combined, as wellas for each of the four quartiles of the question’s duration.Table 3: Results with the test questions (Accuracy: average percentage of days a model predicts aquestion correctly). Results are provided for all days a question was open and for four quartiles (Q1:first 25% of days, Q2: 25-50%, Q3: 50-75%, and Q4: last 25% of days).Days When the Question Was OpenModel All Days Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4Using Daily Forecasts OnlyBaselinesMajority Vote (predictions) 71.89 64.59 66.59 73.26 82.22Weighted Vote (predictions) 73.79 67.79 68.71 74.16 83.61Neural Network VariantsPredictions Only 77.96 77.62 77.93 78.23 78.61Predictions + Question 77.61 75.44 76.77 78.05 81.56Predictions + Justifications 80.23 77.87 78.65 79.26 84.67Predictions + Question + Justifications 79.96 78.65 78.11 80.29 83.28Using Active ForecastsBaselinesMajority Vote (predictions) 77.27 68.83 73.92 77.98 87.44Weighted Vote (predictions) 77.97 72.04 72.17 78.53 88.22Neural Network VariantsPredictions Only 78.81 77.31 78.04 78.53 81.11Predictions + Question 79.35 76.05 78.53 79.56 82.94Predictions + Justifications 80.84 77.86 79.07 79.74 86.17Predictions + Question + Justifications 81.27 78.71 79.81 81.56 84.67Despite their relative simplicity, the baseline methods achieve commendable results, demonstratingthat aggregating forecaster predictions without considering the question or justifications is a viablestrategy. However, the full neural network achieves significantly improved results.**Using Daily or Active Forecasts** Incorporating active forecasts, rather than solely relying onforecasts submitted on the day the question is called, proves advantageous for both baselines and allneural network configurations, except for the one using only predictions and justifications.**Encoding Questions and Justifications** The neural network that only utilizes the predictionto represent a forecast surpasses both baseline methods. Notably, integrating the question, thejustification, or both into the forecast representation yields further improvements. These resultsindicate that incorporating the question and forecaster-provided justifications into the model enhancesthe accuracy of question calling.**Calling Questions Throughout Their Life** When examining the results across the four quartiles ofa question’s duration, it’s observed that while using active forecasts is beneficial across all quartilesfor both baselines and all network configurations, the neural networks surprisingly outperform thebaselines only in the first three quartiles. In the last quartile, the neural networks perform significantlyworse than the baselines. This suggests that while modeling questions and justifications is generallyhelpful, it becomes detrimental toward the end of a question’s life. This phenomenon can be attributedto the increasing wisdom of the crowd as more evidence becomes available and more forecasterscontribute, making their aggregated predictions more accurate.5Table 4: Results with the test questions, categorized by question difficulty as determined by the bestbaseline model. The table presents the accuracy (average percentage of days a question is predictedcorrectly) for all questions and for each quartile of difficulty: Q1 (easiest 25%), Q2 (25-50%), Q3(50-75%), and Q4 (hardest 25%).

This helps to understand which questions benefit most from the neuralnetworks that incorporate questions and justifications. However, it’s important to note that calculatingquestion difficulty during the question’s active period is not feasible, making these experimentsunrealistic before the question closes and the correct answer is revealed.Table 4 presents the results for selected models based on question difficulty. The weighted votebaseline demonstrates superior performance for 755 Qualitative AnalysisThis section provides insights into the factors that make questions more difficult to forecast andexamines the characteristics of justifications associated with incorrect and correct predictions.**Questions** An analysis of the 88 questions in the test set revealed that questions called incorrectlyon at least one day by the best model tend to have a shorter duration (69.4 days vs. 81.7 days) and ahigher number of active forecasts per day (31.0 vs. 26.7). This suggests that the model’s errors alignwith the questions that forecasters also find challenging.**Justifications** A manual review of 400 justifications (200 associated with incorrect predictionsand 200 with correct predictions) was conducted, focusing on those submitted on days when the bestmodel made an incorrect prediction. The following observations were made:* A higher percentage of incorrect predictions (78%) were accompanied by short justifications(fewer than 20 tokens), compared to 65% for correct predictions. This supports the idea that longeruser-generated text often indicates higher quality. * References to previous forecasts (either by thesame or other forecasters, or the current crowd’s forecast) were more common in justifications forincorrect predictions (31.5%) than for correct predictions (16%). * A lack of a logical argumentwas prevalent in the justifications, regardless of the prediction’s accuracy. However, it was morefrequent in justifications for incorrect predictions (62.5%) than for correct predictions (47.5%). *Surprisingly, justifications with generic arguments did not clearly differentiate between incorrect andcorrect predictions (16.0% vs. 14.5%). * Poor grammar and spelling or the use of non-English wereinfrequent but more common in justifications for incorrect predictions (24.5%) compared to correctpredictions (14.5%).6 ConclusionsForecasting involves predicting future events, a capability highly valued by both governments andindustries as it enables them to anticipate and address potential challenges. This study focuses onquestions spanning the political, economic, and social domains, utilizing forecasts submitted by acrowd of individuals without specialized training. Each forecast comprises a prediction and a naturallanguage justification. 6The research demonstrates that aggregating the weighted predictions of forecasters is a solid baselinefor calling a question throughout its duration. However, models that incorporate both the questionand the justifications achieve significantly better results, particularly during the first three quartiles ofa question’s life. Importantly, the models developed in this study do not profile individual forecastersor utilize any information about their identities. This work lays the groundwork for evaluating thecredibility of anonymous forecasts, enabling the development of robust aggregation strategies that donot require tracking individual forecasters. 7",1,EMNLP
R010,"Detecting Medication Usage in Parkinson’s Disease ThroughMulti-modal Indoor Positioning: A Pilot Study in a NaturalisticEnvironmentAbstractParkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to motor symptoms, including gaitimpairment. The effectiveness of levodopa therapy, a common treatment for PD, can fluctuate, causing periods ofimproved mobility (""on"" state) and periods where symptoms re-emerge (""off"" state). These fluctuations impactgait speed and increase in severity as the disease progresses. This paper proposes a transformer-based method thatuses both Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and accelerometer data from wearable devices to enhanceindoor localization accuracy. A secondary goal is to determine if indoor localization, particularly in-home gaitspeed features (like the time to walk between rooms), can be used to identify motor fluctuations by detecting if aperson with PD is taking their levodopa medication or not. The method is evaluated using a real-world datasetcollected in a free-living setting, where movements are varied and unstructured. Twenty-four participants, livingin pairs (one with PD and one control), resided in a sensor-equipped smart home for five days. The results showthat the proposed network surpasses other methods for indoor localization. The evaluation of the secondary goalreveals that accurate room-level localization, when converted into in-home gait speed features, can accuratelypredict whether a PD participant is taking their medication or not.1 IntroductionParkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition that affects approximately 6 million individuals globally.It manifests through various motor symptoms, including bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and gait impairment. Acommon complication associated with levodopa, the primary medication for PD, is the emergence of motor fluctuations that arelinked to medication timing. Initially, patients experience a consistent and extended therapeutic effect when starting levodopa.However, as the disease advances, a significant portion of patients begin to experience ""wearing off"" of their medication beforethe next scheduled dose, resulting in the reappearance of parkinsonian symptoms, such as slowed gait. These fluctuations insymptoms negatively impact patients’ quality of life and often necessitate adjustments to their medication regimen. The severityof motor symptoms can escalate to the point where they impede an individual’s ability to walk and move within their own home.Consequently, individuals may be inclined to remain confined to a single room, and when they do move, they may require more timeto transition between rooms. These observations could potentially be used to identify periods when PD patients are experiencingmotor fluctuations related to their medication being in an ON or OFF state, thereby providing valuable information to both cliniciansand patients.A sensitive and accurate ecologically-validated biomarker for PD progression is currently unavailable, which has contributed tofailures in clinical trials for neuroprotective therapies in PD. Gait parameters are sensitive to disease progression in unmedicatedearly-stage PD and show promise as markers of disease progression, making measuring gait parameters potentially useful in clinicaltrials of disease-modifying interventions. Clinical evaluations of PD are typically conducted in artificial clinic or laboratory settings,which only capture a limited view of an individual’s motor function. Continuous monitoring could capture symptom progression,including motor fluctuations, and sensitively quantify them over time.While PD symptoms, including gait and balance parameters, can be measured continuously at home using wearable devicescontaining inertial motor units (IMUs) or smartphones, this data does not show the context in which the measurements are taken.Determining a person’s location within a home (indoor localization) could provide valuable contextual information for interpretingPD symptoms. For instance, symptoms like freezing of gait and turning in gait vary depending on the environment, so knowing aperson’s location could help predict such symptoms or interpret their severity. Additionally, understanding how much time someonespends alone or with others in a room is a step towards understanding their social participation, which impacts quality of life inPD. Localization could also provide valuable information in the measurement of other behaviors such as non-motor symptoms likeurinary function (e.g., how many times someone visits the toilet room overnight).IoT-based platforms with sensors capturing various modalities of data, combined with machine learning, can be used for unobtrusiveand continuous indoor localization in home environments. Many of these techniques utilize radio-frequency signals, specifically theReceived Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), emitted by wearables and measured at access points (AP) throughout a home. Thesesignals estimate the user’s position based on perceived signal strength, creating radio-map features for each room. To improvelocalization accuracy, accelerometer data from wearable devices, along with RSSI, can be used to distinguish different activities(e.g., walking vs. standing). Since some activities are associated with specific rooms (e.g., stirring a pan on the stove is likely tooccur in a kitchen), accelerometer data can enhance RSSI’s ability to differentiate between adjacent rooms, an area where RSSIalone may be insufficient.The heterogeneity of PD, where symptoms and their severity vary between patients, poses a challenge for generalizing accelerometerdata across different individuals. Severe symptoms, such as tremors, can introduce bias and accumulated errors in accelerometer data,particularly when collected from wrist-worn devices, which are a common and well-accepted placement location. Naively combiningaccelerometer data with RSSI may degrade indoor localization performance due to varying tremor levels in the acceleration signal.This work makes two primary contributions to address these challenges.(1) We detail the use of RSSI, augmented by accelerometer data, to achieve room-level localization. Our proposed networkintelligently selects accelerometer features that can enhance RSSI performance in indoor localization. To rigorously assess ourmethod, we utilize a free-living dataset (where individuals live without external intervention) developed by our group, encompassingdiverse and unstructured movements as expected in real-world scenarios. Evaluation on this dataset, including individuals with andwithout PD, demonstrates that our network outperforms other methods across all cross-validation categories.(2) We demonstrate how accurate room-level localization predictions can be transformed into in-home gait speed biomarkers (e.g.,number of room-to-room transitions, room-to-room transition duration). These biomarkers can effectively classify the OFF or ONmedication state of a PD patient from this pilot study data.2 Related WorkExtensive research has utilized home-based passive sensing systems to evaluate how the activities and behavior of individuals withneurological conditions, primarily cognitive dysfunction, change over time. However, there is limited work assessing room use inthe home setting in people with Parkinson’s.Gait quantification using wearables or smartphones is an area where a significant amount of work has been done. Cameras canalso detect parkinsonian gait and some gait features, including step length and average walking speed. Time-of-flight devices,which measure distances between the subject and the camera, have been used to assess medication adherence through gait analysis.From free-living data, one approach to gait and room use evaluation in home settings is by emitting and detecting radio waves tonon-invasively track movement. Gait analysis using radio wave technology shows promise to track disease progression, severity, andmedication response. However, this approach cannot identify who is doing the movement and also suffers from technical issueswhen the radio waves are occluded by another object. Much of the work done so far using video to track PD symptoms has focusedon the performance of structured clinical rating scales during telemedicine consultations as opposed to naturalistic behavior, andthere have been some privacy concerns around the use of video data at home.RSSI data from wearable devices is a type of data with fewer privacy concerns; it can be measured continuously and unobtrusivelyover long periods to capture real-world function and behavior in a privacy-friendly way. In indoor localization, fingerprinting usingRSSI is the typical technique used to estimate the wearable (user) location by using signal strength data representing a coarse andnoisy estimate of the distance from the wearable to the access point. RSSI signals are not stable; they fluctuate randomly due toshadowing, fading, and multi-path effects. However, many techniques have been proposed in recent years to tackle these fluctuationsand indirectly improve localization accuracy. Some works utilize deep neural networks (DNN) to generate coarse positioningestimates from RSSI signals, which are then refined by a hidden Markov model (HMM) to produce a final location estimate. Otherworks try to utilize a time series of RSSI data and exploit the temporal connections within each access point to estimate room-levelposition. A CNN is used to build localization models to further leverage the temporal dependencies across time-series readings.It has been suggested that we cannot rely on RSSI alone for indoor localization in home environments for PD subjects due toshadowing rooms with tight separation. Some researchers combine RSSI signals and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to testthe viability of leveraging other sensors in aiding the positioning system to produce a more accurate location estimate. Classicmachine learning approaches such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) aretested, and the result shows that the RF outperforms other methods in tracking a person in indoor environments. Others combinesmartphone IMU sensor data and Wi-Fi-received signal strength indication (RSSI) measurements to estimate the exact location (inEuclidean position X, Y) of a person in indoor environments. The proposed sensor fusion framework uses location fingerprinting incombination with a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm to reduce positioning errors.Looking at this multi-modality classification/regression problem from a time series perspective, there has been a lot of explorationin tackling a problem where each modality can be categorized as multivariate time series data. LSTM and attention layers areoften used in parallel to directly transform raw multivariate time series data into a low-dimensional feature representation for eachmodality. Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e.g.,concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer2data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption. In addition, unlike previouswork that stops at predicting room locations, we go a step further and use room-to-room transition behaviors as features for a binaryclassifier predicting whether people with PD are taking their medications or withholding them.3 Cohort and Dataset**Dataset:** This dataset was collected using wristband wearable sensors, one on each wrist of all participants, containing tri-axialaccelerometers and 10 Access Points (APs) placed throughout the residential home, each measuring the RSSI. The wearable deviceswirelessly transmit data using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, which can be received by the 10 APs. Each AP records thetransmitted packets from the wearable sensor, which contains the accelerometer readings sampled at 30Hz, with each AP recordingRSSI values sampled at 5 Hz.The dataset contains 12 spousal/parent-child/friend-friend pairs (24 participants in total) living freely in a smart home for five days.Each pair consists of one person with PD and one healthy control volunteer (HC). This pairing was chosen to enable PD vs. HCcomparison, for safety reasons, and also to increase the naturalistic social behavior (particularly amongst the spousal pairs whoalready lived together). From the 24 participants, five females and seven males have PD. The average age of the participants is 60.25(PD 61.25, Control 59.25), and the average time since PD diagnosis for the person with PD is 11.3 years (range 0.5-19).To measure the accuracy of the machine learning models, wall-mounted cameras are installed on the ground floor of the house,which capture red-green-blue (RGB) and depth data 2-3 hours daily (during daylight hours at times when participants were at home).The videos were then manually annotated to the nearest millisecond to provide localization labels. Multiple human labelers usedsoftware called ELAN to watch up to 4 simultaneously-captured video files at a time. The resulting labeled data recorded the kitchen,hallway, dining room, living room, stairs, and porch. The duration of labeled data recorded by the cameras for PD and HC is 72.84and 75.31 hours, respectively, which provides a relatively balanced label set for our room-level classification. Finally, to evaluatethe ON/OFF medication state, participants with PD were asked to withhold their dopaminergic medications so that they were inthe practically-defined OFF medications state for a temporary period of several hours during the study. Withholding medicationsremoves their mitigation on symptoms, leading to mobility deterioration, which can include slowing of gait.**Data pre-processing for indoor localization:** The data from the two wearable sensors worn by each participant were combined ateach time point, based on their modality, i.e., twenty RSSI values (corresponding to 10 APs for each of the two wearable sensors)and accelerometry traces in six spatial directions (corresponding to the three spatial directions (x, y, z) for each wearable) wererecorded at each time point. The accelerometer data is resampled to 5Hz to synchronize the data with RSSI values. With a 5-secondtime window and a 5Hz sampling rate, each RSSI data sample has an input of size (25 x 20), and accelerometer data has an input ofsize (25 x 6). Imputation for missing values, specifically for RSSI data, is applied by replacing the missing values with a value that isnot possible normally (i.e., -120dB). Missing values exist in RSSI data whenever the wearable is out of range of an AP. Finally, alltime-series measurements by the modalities are normalized.**Data pre-processing for medication state:** Our main focus is for our neural network to continuously produce room predictions,which are then transformed into in-home gait speed features, particularly for persons with PD. We hypothesize that during theirOFF medication state, the deterioration in mobility of a person with PD is exhibited by how they transition between rooms. Thesefeatures include ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ and the ’Number of Transitions’ between two rooms. ’Number of Transitions’represents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ may provideinsight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the housewhere participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and ’Room-to-room Transition’ showsthe transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and livingroom, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality acrossall participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e., the time spent in the hallway) to 60 seconds to excludetransitions likely to be prolonged and thus may not be representative of the person’s mobility.These in-home gait speed features are produced by an indoor-localization model by feeding RSSI signals and accelerometer datafrom 12 PD participants from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, which are aggregated into 4-hour windows. From this, each PD participantwill have 20 data samples (four data samples for each of the five days), each of which contains six features (three for the mean ofroom-to-room transition duration and three for the number of room-to-room transitions). There is only one 4-hour window duringwhich the person with PD is OFF medications. These samples are then used to train a binary classifier determining whether a personwith PD is ON or OFF their medications.For a baseline comparison to the in-home gait speed features, demographic features which include age, gender, years of PD, andMDS-UPDRS III score (the gold-standard clinical rating scale score used in clinical trials to measure motor disease severity inPD) are chosen. Two MDS-UPDRS III scores are assigned for each PD participant; one is assigned when a person with PD is ONmedications, and the other one is assigned when a person with PD is OFF medications. For each in-home gait speed feature datasample, there will be a corresponding demographic feature data sample that is used to train a different binary classifier to predictwhether a person with PD is ON or OFF medications.**Ethical approval:** Full approval from the NHS Wales Research Ethics Committee was granted on December 17, 2019, andHealth Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales approval was confirmed on January 14, 2020; the research was3conducted in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975; written informed consent was gained from all study participants. Inorder to protect participant privacy, supporting data is not shared openly. It will be made available to bona fide researchers subject toa data access agreement.4 Methodologies and FrameworkWe introduce Multihead Dual Convolutional Self Attention (MDCSA), a deep neural network that utilizes dual modalities for indoorlocalization in home environments. The network addresses two challenges that arise from multimodality and time-series data:(1) Capturing multivariate features and filtering multimodal noises. RSSI signals, which are measured at multiple access pointswithin a home received from wearable communication, have been widely used for indoor localization, typically using a fingerprintingtechnique that produces a ground truth radio map of a home. Naturally, the wearable also produces acceleration measurements whichcan be used to identify typical activities performed in a specific room, and thus we can explore if accelerometer data will enrichthe RSSI signals, in particular to help distinguish adjacent rooms, which RSSI-only systems typically struggle with. If it will, howcan we incorporate these extra features (and modalities) into the existing features for accurate room predictions, particularly in thecontext of PD where the acceleration signal may be significantly impacted by the disease itself?(2) Modeling local and global temporal dynamics. The true correlations between inputs both intra-modality (i.e., RSSI signal amongaccess points) and inter-modality (i.e., RSSI signal against accelerometer fluctuation) are dynamic. These dynamics can affect oneanother within a local context (e.g., cyclical patterns) or across long-term relationships. Can we capture local and global relationshipsacross different modalities?The MDCSA architecture addresses the aforementioned challenges through a series of neural network layers, which are described inthe following sections.4.1 Modality Positional EmbeddingDue to different data dimensionality between RSSI and accelerometer, coupled with the missing temporal information, a linearlayer with a positional encoding is added to transform both RSSI and accelerometer data into their respective embeddings. SupposeR RT ×r T ×ar r r r a a a a] ∈ ] ∈x = [x , x , ..., x x = [x , x , ..., xwe have a collection of RSSI signals and accelerometer data within1 2 1 2T Tr r r a a ar a] ]= [x , x , ..., x = [x , x , ..., xT x r xtime units, where represents RSSI signals from access points, and representstr tat tt1 t2 t1 t2r aa t t < T x = [x , x ] u ∈ {r, a}accelerometer data from spatial directions at time with .

Utilizing historical context that can capture local patterns ontop of point-wise values, performance improvements in attention-based architectures can be achieved. One straightforward option isto utilize a recurrent neural network such as a long-short term memory (LSTM) approach. However, in LSTM layers, the localcontext is summarized based on the previous context and the current input. Two similar patterns separated by a long period of timemight have different contexts if they are processed by the LSTM layers. We utilize a combination of causal convolution layers andRN×dxˆ ∈self-attention layers, which we name Dual Convolutional Self-Attention (DCSA). The DCSA takes in a primary input 1RN×dxˆ ∈and a secondary input and yields:2 DCSA(xˆ , xˆ ) = GRN (N orm(ϕ(xˆ ) + xˆ ), N orm(ϕ(xˆ ) + xˆ )) (2)1 2 1 1 2 2with ϕ(xˆ) = SA(Φ (xˆ)W , Φ (xˆ)W , Φ (xˆ)W ) (3)k Q k K k VGRN (.)

Note that all weights for GRN are shared across each time step .44.3 Multihead Dual Convolutional Self-AttentionOur approach employs a self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies across time steps. It is embedded as part of theDCSA architecture. Inspired by utilizing multihead self-attention, we utilize our DCSA with various kernel lengths with the sameRN×dxˆ , xˆ ∈aim: allowing asymmetric long-term learning. The multihead DCSA takes in two inputs and yields:1 2M DCSA (xˆ , xˆ ) = Ξ (ϕ (xˆ , xˆ )) (4)k ,...,k 1 2 n k ,...,k 1 21 n 1 nwith ϕ (xˆ , xˆ ) = SA(Φ (xˆ )W , Φ (xˆ )W , Φ (xˆ , xˆ )W ) (5)k 1 2 k 1 Q k 2 K k 1 2 Vi i i i R R Rd×d d×d d×dΦ (.) {1, k } k W ∈ , W ∈ , W ∈where is a 1D-convolutional layer with a kernel size and a stride , arek i i K Q Vi Ξ (.) DCSA (.)weights for keys, queries, and values of the self-attention layer, and concatenates the output of each in temporaln kiorder. For regularization, a normalization layer followed by a dropout layer is added after Equation 4. r r rh = [h , ..., h ]Following the modality positional embedding layer in subsection 4.1, the positional embeddings of RSSI and1 Ta a ah = [h , ..., h ] [k , ..., k ]accelerometer , produced by Eq. 1, are then fed to an MDCSA layer with various kernel sizes :1 n1 T r ah = M DCSA (h , h ) (6)k ,...,k1 nRdh = [h , ..., h ] h ∈ t < Tto yield with and .1 T t4.4 Final Layer and Loss CalculationWe apply two different layers to produce two different outputs during training. The room-level predictions are produced via a singleconditional random field (CRF) layer in combination with a linear layer applied to the output of Eq. 7 to produce the final predictionsas: yˆ = CRF (ϕ(h )) (7)t t′q (h ) = W h + b (8)t p t pR R Rd×m m T ×dW ∈ b ∈ m h = [h , ..., h ] ∈where and are the weight and bias to learn, is the number of room locations, andp p 1 Tis the refined embedding produced by Eq. 7. Even though the transformer can take into account neighbor information beforetgenerating the refined embedding at time step , its decision is independent; it does not take into account the actual decision made bytother refined embeddings . We use a CRF layer to cover just that, i.e., to maximize the probability of the refined embeddings of alltime steps, so it can better model cases where refined embeddings closest to one another must be compatible (i.e., minimizing theyˆpossibility for impossible room transitions). When finding the best sequence of room location , the Viterbi Algorithm is used as atstandard for the CRF layer. tFor the second layer, we choose a particular room as a reference and perform a binary classification at each time step . The binaryhclassification is produced via a linear layer applied to the refined embedding as:tˆf = W h + b (9)t f t fˆ ˆ ˆR R Rd×1 TW ∈ b ∈ f = [f , ..., f ] ∈where and are the weight and bias to learn, and is the target probabilities for thef f 1 TTreferenced room within time window . The reason to perform a binary classification against a particular room is because of ourinterest in improving the accuracy in predicting that room. In our application, the room of our choice is the hallway, where it will beused as a hub connecting any other room.**Loss Functions:** During the training process, the MDCSA network produces two kinds of outputs. Emission outputs (outputseˆ = [ϕ(h ), ..., ϕ(h )]produced by Equation 9 prior to prediction outputs) are trained to generate the likelihood estimate of room1 Tˆ ˆ ˆf = [f , ..., f ]predictions, while the binary classification output is used to train the probability estimate of a particular room. The1 Tfinal loss function can be formulated as a combination of both likelihood and binary cross-entropy loss functions described as:T(cid:88)ˆ ˆL(eˆ, y, f , f ) = L (eˆ, y) + L (f , f ) (10)LL BCE t tt=1T T(cid:88) (cid:88)T TL (eˆ, y) = P (ϕ(h ))q (y |y ) − P (ϕ(h ))[q (y |y )] (11)LL i i i−1 i i i−1i ii=0 i=05T1 (cid:88)ˆ ˆ ˆL (f , f ) = − f log(f ) + (1 − f ) log(1 − f ) (12)BCE t t t tT t=0 RTL (.)

For the modified transformer encoder, at each time step , RSSI and accelerometer features are combined via at tlinear layer before they are processed by the networks. A grid search on the parameters of each network is performed to find the bestdparameter for each model. The parameters to tune are the embedding dimension in 128, 256, the number of epochs in 200, 300,and the learning rate in 0.01, 0.0001. The dropout rate is set to 0.15, and a specific optimizer in combination with a Look-Aheadalgorithm is used for the training with early stopping using the validation performance. For the RF, we perform a cross-validatedparameter search for the number of trees (200, 250), the minimum number of samples in a leaf node (1, 5), and whether a warm startis needed. The Gini impurity is used to measure splits.**Evaluation Metrics:** We are interested in developing a system to monitor PD motor symptoms in home environments. Forexample, we will consider if there is any significant difference in the performance of the system when it is trained with PD datacompared to being trained with healthy control (HC) data. We tailored our training procedure to test our hypothesis by performingvariations of cross-validation. Apart from training our models on all HC subjects (ALL-HC), we also perform four different kinds ofcross-validation: 1) We train our models on one PD subject (LOO-PD), 2) We train our models on one HC subject (LOO-HC), 3) Wetake one HC subject and use only roughly four minutes’ worth of data to train our models (4m-HC), 4) We take one PD subject anduse only roughly four minutes’ worth of data to train our models (4m-PD). For all of our experiments, we test our trained models onall PD subjects (excluding the one used as training data for LOO-PD and 4m-PD). For room-level localization accuracy, we useprecision and weighted F1-score, all averaged and standard deviated across the test folds.To showcase the importance of in-home gait speed features in differentiating the medication state of a person with PD, we firstcompare how accurate the ’Room-to-room Transition’ duration produced by each network is to the ground truth (i.e., annotatedlocation). We hypothesize that the more accurate the transition is compared to the ground truth, the better mobility features are formedication state classification. For the medication state classification, we then compare two different groups of features with twosimple binary classifiers: 1) the baseline demographic features (see Section 3), and 2) the normalized in-home gait speed features.The metric we use for ON/OFF medication state evaluation is the weighted F1-Score and AUROC, which are averaged and standarddeviated across the test folds.5.1 Experimental Results**Room-level Accuracy:** The first part of Table 1 compares the performance of the MDCSA network and other approaches forroom-level classification. For room-level classification, the MDCSA network outperforms other networks and RF with a minimumimprovement of 1.3% for the F1-score over the second-best network in each cross-validation type, with the exception of the ALL-HCvalidation. The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with anaverage improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model.The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps willperform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-artmodel perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However,when the training data becomes limited, as in 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, having extra capabilities is necessary to furtherextract temporal information and correlations. Due to being a vanilla transformer requiring a considerable amount of trainingdata, the modified transformer encoder performs worst in these two validations. The state-of-the-art model performs quite well6due to its ability to capture local context via LSTM for each modality. However, in general, its performance suffers in both theLOO-PD and 4m-PD validations as the accelerometer data (and modality) may be erratic due to PD and should be excluded attimes from contributing to room classification. The MDCSA network has all the capabilities that the state-of-the-art model has,with an improvement in suppressing the accelerometer modality when needed via the GRN layer embedded in DCSA. Suppressingthe noisy modality seems to have a strong impact on maintaining the performance of the network when the training data is limited.This is validated by how the alternative to the state-of-the-art model (i.e., the state-of-the-art model with added GRN and CRFlayers) outperforms the standard state-of-the-art model by an average of 2.2% for the F1-score in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations.It is further confirmed by MDCSA1,4,7 4APS against MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI, with the latter model, which does not includethe accelerometer data, outperforming the former for the F1-score by an average of 1.6% in the last three cross-validations. It isworth pointing out that the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model performed the best in the 4m-PD validation. However, the omission ofaccelerometer data affects the model’s ability to differentiate rooms that are more likely to have active movement (i.e., hall) than therooms that are not (i.e., living room). It can be seen from Table 2 that the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model has low performance inpredicting the hallway compared to the full model of MDCSA1,4,7. As a consequence, the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model cannotproduce in-home gait speed features asaccurately, as shown in Table 3.**Room-to-room Transition and Medication Accuracy:** We hypothesize that during their OFF medication state, the deteriorationin mobility of a person with PD is exhibited by how they transition between rooms. To test this hypothesis, a Wilcoxon signed-ranktest was used on the annotated data from PD participants undertaking each of the three individual transitions between rooms whilstON (taking) and OFF (withholding) medications to assess whether the mean transition duration ON medications was statisticallysignificantly shorter than the mean transition duration for the same transition OFF medications for all transitions studied (see Table4). From this result, we argue that the mean transition duration obtained by each model from Table 1 that is close to the ground truthcan capture what the ground truth captures. As mentioned in Section 3, this transition duration for each model is generated by themodel continuously performing room-level localization, focusing on the time a person is predicted to spend in a hallway betweenrooms. We show, in Table 3, that the mean transition duration for all transitions studied produced by the MDCSA1,4,7 model is theclosest to the ground truth, improving over the second best by around 1.25 seconds across all hall transitions and validations.The second part of Table 1 shows the performance of all our networks for medication state classification. The demographicfeatures can be used as a baseline for each type of validation. The MDCSA network, with the exception of the ALL-HC validation,outperforms any other network by a significant margin for the AUROC score. By using in-home gait speed features produced bythe MDCSA network, a minimum of 15% improvement over the baseline demographic features can be obtained, with the biggestgain obtained in the 4m-PD validation data. In the 4m-PD validation data, RF, TENER, and DTML could not manage to provideany prediction due to their inability to capture (partly) hall transitions. Furthermore, TENER has shown its inability to provide anymedication state prediction from the 4m-HC data validations. It can be validated by Table 3 when TENER failed to capture anytransitions between the dining room and living room across all periods that have ground truths. MDCSA networks can providemedication state prediction and maintain their performance across all cross-validations thanks to the addition of Eq. 13 in the lossfunction.**Limitations and future research:** One limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size (which was planned as this isan exploratory pilot study). We believe our sample size is ample to show proof of concept. This is also the first such work withunobtrusive ground truth validation from embedded cameras. Future work should validate our approach further on a large cohortof people with PD and consider stratifying for sub-groups within PD (e.g., akinetic-rigid or tremor-dominant phenotypes), whichwould also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include theconstruction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.This smart home’s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deeplearning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation andbased on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, andalso suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants toundertake scripted activities such as moving from room to room) to fully validate the performance of our approach in other settings.6 ConclusionWe have presented the MDCSA model, a new deep learning approach for indoor localization utilizing RSSI and wrist-wornaccelerometer data. The evaluation on our unique real-world free-living pilot dataset, which includes subjects with and without PD,shows that MDCSA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for indoor localization. The availability of accelerometer data does indeedenrich the RSSI features, which, in turn, improves the accuracy of indoor localization.Accurate room localization using these data modalities has a wide range of potential applications within healthcare. This couldinclude tracking of gait speed during rehabilitation from orthopedic surgery, monitoring wandering behavior in dementia, ortriggering an alert for a possible fall (and long lie on the floor) if someone is in one room for an unusual length of time. Furthermore,accurate room use and room-to-room transfer statistics could be used in occupational settings, e.g., to check factory worker location.7Table 1: Room-level and medication state accuracy of all models.

We have shown, usingroom transition duration results, that our PD cohort takes longer on average to perform a room transition when they withholdmedications. With accurate in-home gait speed features, a classifier model can then differentiate accurately if a person with PD is inan ON or OFF medication state. Such changes show the promise of these localization outputs to detect the dopamine-related gaitfluctuations in PD that impact patients’ quality of life and are important in clinical decision-making.

R011,"Addressing Popularity Bias with Popularity-Conscious Alignment andContrastive LearningAbstractCollaborative Filtering (CF) often encounters substantial difficulties with popularity bias because of the skeweddistribution of items in real-world datasets. This tendency creates a notable difference in accuracy between itemsthat are popular and those that are not. This discrepancy impedes the accurate comprehension of user preferencesand intensifies the Matthew effect within recommendation systems. To counter popularity bias, current methodsconcentrate on highlighting less popular items or on differentiating the correlation between item representationsand their popularity. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches continue to grapple with two significantissues: firstly, the extraction of shared supervisory signals from popular items to enhance the representations ofless popular items, and secondly, the reduction of representation separation caused by popularity bias. In thisstudy, we present an empirical examination of popularity bias and introduce a method called Popularity-AwareAlignment and Contrast (PAAC) to tackle these two problems. Specifically, we utilize the common supervisorysignals found in popular item representations and introduce an innovative popularity-aware supervised alignmentmodule to improve the learning of representations for unpopular items. Furthermore, we propose adjusting theweights in the contrastive learning loss to decrease the separation of representations by focusing on popularity.We confirm the efficacy and logic of PAAC in reducing popularity bias through thorough experiments on threereal-world datasets.1 IntroductionContemporary recommender systems are essential in reducing information overload. Personalized recommendations frequentlyemploy collaborative filtering (CF) to assist users in discovering items that may interest them. CF-based techniques primarilylearn user preferences and item attributes by matching the representations of users with the items they engage with. Despite theirachievements, CF-based methods frequently encounter the issue of popularity bias, which leads to considerable disparities inaccuracy between items that are popular and those that are not. Popularity bias occurs because there are limited supervisory signalsfor items that are not popular, which results in overfitting during the training phase and decreased effectiveness on the test set. Thishinders the precise comprehension of user preferences, thereby diminishing the variety of recommendations. Furthermore, popularitybias can worsen the Matthew effect, where items that are already popular gain even more popularity because they are recommendedmore frequently.Two significant challenges are presented when mitigating popularity bias in recommendation systems. The first challenge is theinadequate representation of unpopular items during training, which results in overfitting and limited generalization ability. Thesecond challenge, known as representation separation, happens when popular and unpopular items are categorized into distinctsemantic spaces, thereby intensifying the bias and diminishing the precision of recommendations.2 MethodologyTo overcome the current difficulties in reducing popularity bias, we introduce the Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC)method. We utilize the common supervisory signals present in popular item representations to direct the learning of unpopularrepresentations, and we present a popularity-aware supervised alignment module. Moreover, we incorporate a re-weighting systemin the contrastive learning module to deal with representation separation by considering popularity.2.1 Supervised Alignment ModuleDuring the training process, the alignment of representations usually emphasizes users and items that have interacted, often causingitems to be closer to interacted users than non-interacted ones in the representation space. However, because unpopular items havelimited interactions, they are usually modeled based on a small group of users. This limited focus can result in overfitting, as therepresentations of unpopular items might not fully capture their features.The disparity in the quantity of supervisory signals is essential for learning representations of both popular and unpopular items.Specifically, popular items gain from a wealth of supervisory signals during the alignment process, which helps in effectivelylearning their representations. On the other hand, unpopular items, which have a limited number of users providing supervision, aremore susceptible to overfitting. This is because there is insufficient representation learning for unpopular items, emphasizing theeffect of supervisory signal distribution on the quality of representation. Intuitively, items interacted with by the same user havesome similar characteristics. In this section, we utilize common supervisory signals in popular item representations and suggest apopularity-aware supervised alignment method to improve the representations of unpopular items.We initially filter items with similar characteristics based on the user’s interests. For any user, we define the set of items they interactwith. We count the frequency of each item appearing in the training dataset as its popularity. Subsequently, we group items based ontheir relative popularity. We divide items into two groups: the popular item group and the unpopular item group. The popularity ofeach item in the popular group is higher than that of any item in the unpopular group. This indicates that popular items receive moresupervisory information than unpopular items, resulting in poorer recommendation performance for unpopular items.To tackle the issue of insufficient representation learning for unpopular items, we utilize the concept that items interacted with by thesame user share some similar characteristics. Specifically, we use similar supervisory signals in popular item representations toimprove the representations of unpopular items. We align the representations of items to provide more supervisory information tounpopular items and improve their representation, as follows:1(cid:88) (cid:88)L = ||f (i) − f (j)|| , (1)SA 2|I |u u uu∈U i∈I ,j∈Ipop unpopf (·) h = f (i)where is a recommendation encoder and . By efficiently using the inherent information in the data, we provide moreisupervisory signals for unpopular items without introducing additional side information. This module enhances the representation ofunpopular items, mitigating the overfitting issue.2.2 Re-weighting Contrast ModuleRecent research has indicated that popularity bias frequently leads to a noticeable separation in the representation of item embeddings.Although methods based on contrastive learning aim to enhance overall uniformity by distancing negative samples, their currentsampling methods might unintentionally worsen this separation. When negative samples follow the popularity distribution, whichis dominated by popular items, prioritizing unpopular items as positive samples widens the gap between popular and unpopularitems in the representation space. Conversely, when negative samples follow a uniform distribution, focusing on popular itemsseparates them from most unpopular ones, thus worsening the representation gap. Existing studies use the same weights for positiveand negative samples in the contrastive loss function, without considering differences in item popularity. However, in real-worldrecommendation datasets, the impact of items varies due to dataset characteristics and interaction distributions. Neglecting thisaspect could lead to suboptimal results and exacerbate representation separation.We propose to identify different influences by re-weighting different popularity items. To this end, we introduce re-weightingdifferent positive and negative samples to mitigate representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective. We incorporatethis approach into contrastive learning to better optimize the consistency of representations. Specifically, we aim to reduce the riskof pushing items with varying popularity further apart. For example, when using a popular item as a positive sample, our goal isto avoid pushing unpopular items too far away. Thus, we introduce two hyperparameters to control the weights when items areconsidered positive and negative samples.To ensure balanced and equitable representations of items within our model, we first propose a dynamic strategy to categorize itemsinto popular and unpopular groups for each mini-batch. Instead of relying on a fixed global threshold, which often leads to thexoverrepresentation of popular items across various batches, we implement a hyperparameter . This hyperparameter readjusts thexclassification of items within the current batch. By adjusting the hyperparameter , we maintain a balance between different itempopularity levels. This enhances the model’s ability to generalize across diverse item sets by accurately reflecting the popularityI Idistribution in the current training context. Specifically, we denote the set of items within each batch as . And then we divideB BI I x%into a popular group and an unpopular group based on their respective popularity levels, classifying the top of itemspop unpopIas :pop I = I ∪ I , ∀i ∈ I ∧ j ∈ I , p(i) > p(j), (2)B pop unpop pop unpopI ∈ I I ∈ I I x%where and are disjoint, with consisting of the top of items in the batch. In this work, we dynamicallypop B unpop B popdivided items into popular and unpopular groups within each mini-batch based on their popularity, assigning the top 50% as popularitems and the bottom 50% as unpopular items. This radio not only ensures equal representation of both groups in our contrastivelearning but also allows items to be classified adaptively based on the batch’s current composition.After that, we use InfoNCE to optimize the uniformity of item representations. Unlike traditional CL-based methods, we calculateαthe loss for different item groups. Specifically, we introduce the hyperparameter to control the positive sample weights betweenpopular and unpopular items, adapting to varying item distributions in different datasets:2CL CL CLL = α × L + (1 − α) × L , (3)item pop unpopCL CLL Lwhere represents the contrastive loss when popular items are considered as positive samples, and represents thepop unpopα α = 0contrastive loss when unpopular items are considered as positive samples. The value of ranges from 0 to 1, where meansCLL α = 1exclusive emphasis on the loss of unpopular items , and means exclusive emphasis on the loss of popular itemsunpopCLL α. By adjusting , we can effectively balance the impact of positive samples from both popular and unpopular items, allowingpopadaptability to varying item distributions in different datasets. βFollowing this, we fine-tune the weighting of negative samples in the contrastive learning framework using the hyperparameter .This parameter controls how samples from different popularity groups contribute as negative samples. Specifically, we prioritizere-weighting items with popularity opposite to the positive samples, mitigating the risk of excessively pushing negative samplesaway and reducing representation separation. Simultaneously, this approach ensures the optimization of intra-group consistency. Forinstance, when dealing with popular items as positive samples, we separately calculate the impact of popular and unpopular itemsβas negative samples. The hyperparameter is then used to control the degree to which unpopular items are pushed away. This isformalized as follows: ′exp(h h /τ )(cid:88)′ iilog ,L = (4)(cid:80) (cid:80)pop ′ ′exp(h h /τ ) + β exp(h h /τ )j ji ij∈I j∈Ii∈I pop unpoppopsimilarly, the contrastive loss for unpopular items is defined as: ′ h /τ )exp(h(cid:88)′ iiL = log , (5)(cid:80) (cid:80)unpop ′ ′exp(h h /τ ) + β exp(h h /τ )j ji ij∈I j∈Ii∈I unpop popunpopβ β = 0where the parameter ranges from 0 to 1, controlling the negative sample weighting in the contrastive loss. When , it meansβ = 1that only intra-group uniformity optimization is performed. Conversely, when , it means equal treatment of both popular andβunpopular items in terms of their impact on positive samples. The setting of allows for a flexible adjustment between prioritizingintra-group uniformity and considering the impact of different popularity levels in the training. We prefer to push away itemswithin the same group to optimize uniformity. This setup helps prevent over-optimizing the uniformity of different groups, therebymitigating representation separation.The final re-weighting contrastive objective is the weighted sum of the user objective and the item objective:1 CL CLL = × (L + L ). (6)CL item user2In this way, we not only achieved consistency in representation but also reduced the risk of further separating items with similarcharacteristics into different representation spaces, thereby alleviating the issue of representation separation caused by popularitybias.2.3 Model OptimizationTo reduce popularity bias in collaborative filtering tasks, we employ a multi-task training strategy to jointly optimize the classicL L Lrecommendation loss ( ), supervised alignment loss ( ), and re-weighting contrast loss ( ).REC SA CL2L = L + λ L + λ L + λ ||Θ|| , (7)REC 1 SA 2 CL 3Θ L λ λwhere is the set of model parameters in as we do not introduce additional parameters, and are hyperparameters thatREC 1 2control the strengths of the popularity-aware supervised alignment loss and the re-weighting contrastive learning loss respectively,λ Land is the regularization coefficient. After completing the model training process, we use the dot product to predict unknown3 2preferences for recommendations.3 ExperimentsIn this section, we assess the efficacy of PAAC through comprehensive experiments, aiming to address the following researchquestions:• How does PAAC compare to existing debiasing methods?• How do different designed components play roles in our proposed PAAC?3• How does PAAC alleviate the popularity bias?• How do different hyper-parameters affect the PAAC recommendation performance?3.1 Experiments Settings3.1.1 DatasetsIn our experiments, we use three widely public datasets: Amazon-book, Yelp2018, and Gowalla. We retained users and items with aminimum of 10 interactions.3.1.2 Baselines and Evaluation MetricsWe implement the state-of-the-art LightGCN to instantiate PAAC, aiming to investigate how it alleviates popularity bias. Wecompare PAAC with several debiased baselines, including re-weighting-based models, decorrelation-based models, and contrastivelearning-based models.We utilize three widely used metrics, namely Recall@K, HR@K, and NDCG@K, to evaluate the performance of Top-K recommen-dation. Recall@K and HR@K assess the number of target items retrieved in the recommendation results, emphasizing coverage. Incontrast, NDCG@K evaluates the positions of target items in the ranking list, with a focus on their positions in the list. We usethe full ranking strategy, considering all non-interacted items as candidate items to avoid selection bias during the test stage. Werepeated each experiment five times with different random seeds and reported the average scores.3.2 Overall PerformanceAs shown in Table 1, we compare our model with several baselines across three datasets. The best performance for each metricis highlighted in bold, while the second best is underlined. Our model consistently outperforms all compared methods across allmetrics in every dataset.Our proposed model PAAC consistently outperforms all baselines and significantly mitigates the popularity bias. Specif-• ically, PAAC enhances LightGCN, achieving improvements of 282.65%, 180.79%, and 82.89% in NDCG@20 on theYelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book datasets, respectively. Compared to the strongest baselines, PAAC delivers betterperformance. The most significant improvements are observed on Yelp2018, where our model achieves an 8.70% increasein Recall@20, a 10.81% increase in HR@20, and a 30.2% increase in NDCG@20. This improvement can be attributedto our use of popularity-aware supervised alignment to enhance the representation of less popular items and re-weightedcontrastive learning to address representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective.• The performance improvements of PAAC are smaller on sparser datasets. For example, on the Gowalla dataset, theimprovements in Recall@20, HR@20, and NDCG@20 are 3.18%, 5.85%, and 5.47%, respectively. This may be because,in sparser datasets like Gowalla, even popular items are not well-represented due to lower data density. Aligning unpopularitems with these poorly represented popular items can introduce noise into the model. Therefore, the benefits of usingsupervisory signals for unpopular items may be reduced in very sparse environments, leading to smaller performanceimprovements.• Regarding the baselines for mitigating popularity bias, the improvement of some is relatively limited compared to thebackbone model (LightGCN) and even performs worse in some cases. This may be because some are specifically designedfor traditional data-splitting scenarios, where the test set still follows a long-tail distribution, leading to poor generalization.Some mitigate popularity bias by excluding item popularity information. Others use invariant learning to remove popularityinformation at the representation level, generally performing better than the formers. This shows the importance ofaddressing popularity bias at the representation level. Some outperform the other baselines, emphasizing the necessary toimprove item representation consistency for mitigating popularity bias.• Different metrics across various datasets show varying improvements in model performance. This suggests that differentdebiasing methods may need distinct optimization strategies for models. Additionally, we observe varying effects of PAACacross different datasets. This difference could be due to the sparser nature of the Gowalla dataset. Conversely, our modelcan directly provide supervisory signals for unpopular items and conduct intra-group optimization, consistently maintainingoptimal performance across all metrics on the three datasets.3.3 Ablation StudyTo better understand the effectiveness of each component in PAAC, we conduct ablation studies on three datasets. Table 2 presents acomparison between PAAC and its variants on recommendation performance. Specifically, PAAC-w/o P refers to the variant wherethe re-weighting contrastive loss of popular items is removed, focusing instead on optimizing the consistency of representations forunpopular items. Similarly, PAAC-w/o U denotes the removal of the re-weighting contrastive loss for unpopular items. PAAC-w/oA refers to the variant without the popularity-aware supervised alignment loss. It’s worth noting that PAAC-w/o A differs from4Table 1: Performance comparison on three public datasets with K = 20.

This approachpop unpopitemallows us to separately address the consistency of popular and unpopular item representations, thereby providing a more detailedanalysis of the impact of each component on the overall performance.From Table 2, we observe that PAAC-w/o A outperforms SimGCL in most cases. This validates that re-weighting the importance ofpopular and unpopular items can effectively improve the model’s performance in alleviating popularity bias. It also demonstrates theeffectiveness of using supervision signals from popular items to enhance the representations of unpopular items, providing moreopportunities for future research on mitigating popularity bias. Moreover, compared with PAAC-w/o U, PAAC-w/o P results in muchworse performance. This confirms the importance of re-weighting popular items in contrastive learning for mitigating popularitybias. Finally, PAAC consistently outperforms the three variants, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining supervised alignmentand re-weighting contrastive learning. Based on the above analysis, we conclude that leveraging supervisory signals from popularitem representations can better optimize representations for unpopular items, and re-weighting contrastive learning allows the modelto focus on more informative or critical samples, thereby improving overall performance. All the proposed modules significantlycontribute to alleviating popularity bias.Table 2: Ablation study of PAAC, highlighting the best-performing model on each dataset and metrics in bold.

Specifically, 20% of the most popular items are labeled’Popular’, and the rest are labeled ’Unpopular’. We compare the performance of PAAC with LightGCN, IPS, MACR, and SimGCL∆using the NDCG@20 metric across different popularity groups. We use to denote the accuracy gap between the two groups. Wedraw the following conclusions:• Improving the performance of unpopular items is crucial for enhancing overall model performance. Specially, on theYelp2018 dataset, PAAC shows reduced accuracy in recommending popular items, with a notable decrease of 20.14%compared to SimGCL. However, despite this decrease, the overall recommendation accuracy surpasses that of SimGCLby 11.94%, primarily due to a 6.81% improvement in recommending unpopular items. This improvement highlights theimportance of better recommendations for unpopular items and emphasizes their crucial role in enhancing overall modelperformance. 5• Our proposed PAAC significantly enhances the recommendation performance for unpopular items. Specifically, we observean improvement of 8.94% and 7.30% in NDCG@20 relative to SimGCL on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively.This improvement is due to the popularity-aware alignment method, which uses supervisory signals from popular items toimprove the representations of unpopular items.PAAC has successfully narrowed the accuracy gap between different item groups. Specifically, PAAC achieved the smallest• gap, reducing the NDCG@20 accuracy gap by 34.18% and 87.50% on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively.This indicates that our method treats items from different groups fairly, effectively alleviating the impact of popularitybias. This success can be attributed to our re-weighted contrast module, which addresses representation separation from apopularity-centric perspective, resulting in more consistent recommendation results across different groups.3.5 Hyperparameter Sensitivities λ λIn this section, we analyze the impact of hyperparameters in PAAC. Firstly, we investigate the influence of and , which1 2respectively control the impact of the popularity-aware supervised alignment and re-weighting contrast loss. Additionally, in theα βre-weighting contrastive loss, we introduce two hyperparameters, and , to control the re-weighting of different popularity itemsxas positive and negative samples. Finally, we explore the impact of the grouping ratio on the model’s performance.λ λ3.5.1 Effect of and1 2λ λAs formulated in Eq. (11), controls the extent of providing additional supervisory signals for unpopular items, while controls1 2λthe extent of optimizing representation consistency. Horizontally, with the increase in , the performance initially increases and2then decreases. This indicates that appropriate re-weighting contrastive loss effectively enhances the consistency of representationdistributions, mitigating popularity bias. However, overly strong contrastive loss may lead the model to neglect recommendationλaccuracy. Vertically, as increases, the performance also initially increases and then decreases. This suggests that suitable1alignment can provide beneficial supervisory signals for unpopular items, while too strong an alignment may introduce more noisefrom popular items to unpopular ones, thereby impacting recommendation performance.α β3.5.2 Effect of re-weighting coefficient andTo mitigate representation separation due to imbalanced positive and negative sampling, we introduce two hyperparameters into theα βcontrastive loss. Specifically, controls the weight difference between positive samples from popular and unpopular items, whilecontrols the influence of different popularity items as negative samples. α βIn our experiments, while keeping other hyperparameters constant, we search and within the range {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1}. Asα βand increase, performance initially improves and then declines. The optimal hyperparameters for the Yelp2018 and Gowallaα = 0.8 β = 0.6 α = 0.2 β = 0.2datasets are , and , , respectively. This may be attributed to the characteristics of the datasets. TheαYelp2018 dataset, with a higher average interaction frequency per item, benefits more from a higher weight for popular items asαpositive samples. Conversely, the Gowalla dataset, being relatively sparse, prefers a smaller . This indicates the importance ofconsidering dataset characteristics when adjusting the contributions of popular and unpopular items to the model.α βNotably, and are not highly sensitive within the range [0, 1], performing well across a broad spectrum. Performance exceeds theβ αbaseline regardless of values when other parameters are optimal. Additionally, values from [0.4, 1.0] on the Yelp2018 datasetα βand [0.2, 0.8] on the Gowalla dataset surpass the baseline, indicating less need for precise tuning. Thus, and achieve optimalperformance without meticulous adjustments, focusing on weight coefficients to maintain model efficacy.x3.5.3 Effect of grouping ratioTo investigate the impact of different grouping ratios on recommendation performance, we developed a flexible classificationmethod for items within each mini-batch based on their popularity. Instead of adopting a fixed global threshold, which tends tooverrepresent popular items in some mini-batches, our approach dynamically divides items in each mini-batch into popular andx% x xunpopular categories. Specifically, the top of items are classified as popular and the remaining (100 - )% as unpopular, withvarying. This strategy prevents the overrepresentation typical in fixed distribution models, which could skew the learning processand degrade performance. To quantify the effects of these varying ratios, we examined various division ratios for popular items,including 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, as shown in Table 3. The preliminary results indicate that both extremely low and high ratiosnegatively affect model performance, thereby underscoring the superiority of our dynamic data partitioning approach. Moreover,within the 40%-60% range, our model’s performance remained consistently robust, further validating the effectiveness of PAAC.6Table 3: Performance comparison across varying popular item ratios x on metrics.Yelp2018 GowallaRatio Recall@20 HR@20 NDCG@20 Recall@20 HR@20 NDCG@2020% 0.0467 0.0555 0.0361 0.1232 0.1319 0.0845! 40% 0.0505 0.0581 0.0378 0.1239 0.1325 0.084850% 0.0494 0.0574 0.0375 0.1232 0.1321 0.084860% 0.0492 0.0569 0.0370 0.1225 0.1314 0.084380% 0.0467 0.0545 0.0350 0.1176 0.1270 0.08184 Related Work4.1 Popularity Bias in RecommendationPopularity bias is a prevalent problem in recommender systems, where unpopular items in the training dataset are seldom recom-mended. Numerous techniques have been suggested to examine and decrease performance variations between popular and unpopularitems. These techniques can be broadly divided into three categories.• Re-weighting-based methods aim to increase the training weight or scores for unpopular items, redirecting focus awayfrom popular items during training or prediction. For instance, IPS adds compensation to unpopular items and adjuststhe prediction of the user-item preference matrix, resulting in higher preference scores and improving rankings forαunpopular items. -AdjNorm enhances the focus on unpopular items by controlling the normalization strength during theneighborhood aggregation process in GCN-based models.• Decorrelation-based methods aim to effectively remove the correlations between item representations (or prediction scores)and popularity. For instance, MACR uses counterfactual reasoning to eliminate the direct impact of popularity on itemoutcomes. In contrast, InvCF operates on the principle that item representations remain invariant to changes in popularitysemantics, filtering out unstable or outdated popularity characteristics to learn unbiased representations.• Contrastive-learning-based methods aim to achieve overall uniformity in item representations using InfoNCE, preservingmore inherent characteristics of items to mitigate popularity bias. This approach has been demonstrated as a state-of-the-artmethod for alleviating popularity bias. It employs data augmentation techniques such as graph augmentation or featureaugmentation to generate different views, maximizing positive pair consistency and minimizing negative pair consistencyτto promote more uniform representations. Specifically, Adap- adjusts user/item embeddings to specific values, whileSimGCL integrates InfoNCE loss to enhance representation uniformity and alleviate popularity bias.4.2 Representation Learning for CFRepresentation learning is crucial in recommendation systems, especially in modern collaborative filtering (CF) techniques. Itcreates personalized embeddings that capture user preferences and item characteristics. The quality of these representations criticallydetermines a recommender system’s effectiveness by precisely capturing the interplay between user interests and item features.Recent studies emphasize two fundamental principles in representation learning: alignment and uniformity. The alignment principleensures that embeddings of similar or related items (or users) are closely clustered together, improving the system’s ability torecommend items that align with a user’s interests. This principle is crucial when accurately reflecting user preferences throughcorresponding item characteristics. Conversely, the uniformity principle ensures a balanced distribution of all embeddings across therepresentation space. This approach prevents the over-concentration of embeddings in specific areas, enhancing recommendationdiversity and improving generalization to unseen data.In this work, we focus on aligning the representations of popular and unpopular items interacted with by the same user and re-weighting uniformity to mitigate representation separation. Our model PAAC uniquely addresses popularity bias by combining groupalignment and contrastive learning, a first in the field. Unlike previous works that align positive user-item pairs or contrastive pairs,PAAC directly aligns popular and unpopular items, leveraging the rich information of popular items to enhance the representationsof unpopular items and reduce overfitting. Additionally, we introduce targeted re-weighting from a popularity-centric perspective toachieve a more balanced representation.5 ConclusionIn this study, we have examined popularity bias and put forward PAAC as a method to lessen its impact. We postulated that itemsengaged with by the same user exhibit common traits, and we utilized this insight to coordinate the representations of both popularand unpopular items via a popularity-conscious supervised alignment method. This strategy furnished additional supervisory data forless popular items. It is important to note that our concept of aligning and categorizing items according to user-specific preferencesintroduces a fresh perspective on alignment. Moreover, we tackled the problem of representation separation seen in current CL-based7models by incorporating two hyperparameters to regulate the influence of items with varying popularity levels when consideredas positive and negative samples. This method refined the uniformity of representations and successfully reduced separation. Wevalidated our method, PAAC, on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and underlying rationale.In the future, we will explore deeper alignment and contrast adjustments tailored to specific tasks to further mitigate popularitybias. We aim to investigate the synergies between alignment and contrast and extend our approach to address other biases inrecommendation systems.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported in part by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China, the National NaturalScience Foundation of China, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and Quan Cheng Laboratory.8",1,KDD
R012,"Safe Predictors for Input-Output SpecificationEnforcementAbstractThis paper presents an approach for designing neural networks, along with othermachine learning models, which adhere to a collection of input-output specifica-tions. Our method involves the construction of a constrained predictor for each setof compatible constraints, and combining these predictors in a safe manner using aconvex combination of their predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of thismethod with synthetic datasets and on an aircraft collision avoidance problem.1 IntroductionThe increasing adoption of machine learning models, such as neural networks, in safety-criticalapplications, such as autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance, highlights an urgentneed for the development of guarantees on safety and robustness. These models may be requiredto satisfy specific input-output specifications to ensure the algorithms comply with physical laws,can be executed safely, and are consistent with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, these modelsshould demonstrate adversarial robustness, meaning their outputs should not change abruptly withinsmall input regions – a property that neural networks often fail to satisfy.Recent studies have shown the capacity to verify formally input-output specifications and adversarialrobustness properties of neural networks. For instance, the Satisability Modulo Theory (SMT) solverReluplex was employed to verify properties of networks being used in the Next-Generation AircraftCollision Avoidance System for Unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Reluplex has also been used toverify adversarial robustness. While Reluplex and other similar techniques can effectively determineif a network satisfies a given specification, they do not offer a way to guarantee that the network willmeet those specifications. Therefore, additional methods are needed to adjust networks if it is foundthat they are not meeting the desired properties.There has been an increase in techniques for designing networks with certified adversarial robustness,but enforcing more general safety properties in neural networks is still largely unexplored. One ap-proach to achieving provably correct neural networks is through abstraction-refinement optimization.This approach has been applied to the ACAS-Xu dataset, but the network was not guaranteed to meetthe specifications until after training. Our work seeks to design networks with enforced input-outputconstraints even before training has been completed. This will allow for online learning scenarioswhere a system has to guarantee safety throughout its operation.This paper presents an approach for designing a safe predictor (a neural network or any othermachine learning model) that will always meet a set of constraints on the input-output relationship.This assumes that the constrained output regions can be formulated to be convex. Our correct-by-construction safe predictor is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints, even before training, and atevery training step. We describe our approach in Section 2, and show its use in an aircraft collisionavoidance problem in Section 3. Results on synthetic datasets can be found in Appendix B..2 MethodConsidering two normed vector spaces, an input space X and an output space Y , and a collection(A , B ) A ⊆ X Bof c different pairs of input-output constraints, , where and is a convex subseti i i iY i F : X → Yof for each constraint , the goal is to design a safe predictor, , that guaranteesx ∈ A ⇒ F (x) ∈ B .i ib c O z i b = 1Let be a bit-string of length . Define as the set of points such that, for all , impliesb iz ∈ A b = 0 z ∈/ A O, and implies . thus represents the overlap regions for each combination ofi i i bO A A A Oinput constraints. For example, is the set of points in and , but not in , and is101 1 3 2 0...0O b Othe set where no input constraints apply. We also define as the set of bit strings, , such that bk = |O| {O : b ∈ O} Xis non-empty, and define .

For all , if , then .i iA formal proof of Theorem 2.1 is presented in Appendix A and can be summarized as: if an input isAin , then by construction of the proximity and weighting functions, all of the constrained predictors,iG B, that do not map to will be given zero weight. Only the constrained predictors that map tob iB Bwill be given non-zero weight, and because of the convexity of , the weighted average of thei iBpredictions will remain in .iG A A (A ∩ A ) ⊂If all are continuous and if there are no two input sets, and , for whichb i j i jF(∂A ∪∂A ), then will be continuous. In the worst case, as the number of constraints grows linearly,i jthe number of constrained predictors needed to describe our safe predictor grows exponentially. InOpractice, however, we expect many of the constraint overlap sets, , to be empty. Consequently, anybpredictors corresponding to an empty set can be ignored. This significantly reduces the number ofconstrained predictors needed for many applications. F (x)See Figure 1 for an illustrative example of how to construct for a notional problem with twooverlapping input-output constraints.2.1 Proximity Functionsσ xThe proximity functions, , describe how close an input, , is to a particular input constraint region,iA . These functions are used to compute the weights of the constrained predictors. A desirablei σ σ (x) → 1 d(x, A ) → ∞property for is for as , for some distance function. This ensures thati i iwhen an input is far from a constraint region, that constraint has little influence on the prediction forthat input. A natural choice for such a function is: (cid:18) (cid:19)σ2d(x, A )iσ (x; Σ ) = 1 − exp − .i i σ1Σ σ ∈ (0, ∞) σ ∈ (1, ∞)Here, is a set of parameters and , which can be specified based oni 1 2engineering judgment, or learned using optimization over training data. In our experiments inthis paper, we use proximity functions of this form and learn independent parameters for eachinput-constrained region. We plan to explore other choices for proximity functions in future work.22.2 Learning G (x; θ ) θIf we have families of differentiable functions , continuously parameterized by , andb b bσ (x; χ ) χ F (x; Θ, X)families of , differentiable and continuously parameterized by , then , wherei i iΘ = {θ : b ∈ O} X = {χ : i = 1, ..., c}and , is also continuously parameterized and differentiable.b i FWe can thus apply standard optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent) to find parameters ofthat minimize a loss function on some dataset, while also preserving the desired safety properties.G (x; θ )Note that the safety guarantee holds regardless of the parameters.

In manyapplications, it may be advantageous for the constrained predictors to share earlier layers, thuscreating a shared representation of the input space. In addition, our definition of the safe predictor isgeneral and is not limited to neural networks.In Appendix B, we show examples of applying our approach to synthetic datasets in 2-D and 3-Dwith simple neural networks. These examples show that our safe predictor can enforce arbitraryinput-output specifications using convex output constraints on neural networks, and that the learnedfunction is smooth.3 Application to Aircraft Collision AvoidanceAircraft collision avoidance requires robust safety guarantees. The Next-Generation CollisionAvoidance System (ACAS X), which issues advisories to prevent near mid-air collisions, has bothmanned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned (ACAS Xu) variants. The system was originally designed tochoose optimal advisories while minimizing disruptive alerts by solving a partially observable Markovdecision process. The solution took the form of a large look-up table, mapping each possible inputcombination to scores for all possible advisories. The advisory with the highest score would then beissued. By using a deep neural network (DNN) to compress the policy tables, it has been necessary toverify that the DNNs meet certain safety specifications.˘ ˘A desirable 201csafeability201d property for ACAS X was defined in a previous work. This property˘ ˘speci01ed that for any given input state within the 201csafeable region,201d an advisory would neverbe issued that could put the aircraft into a state where a safe advisory would no longer exist. Thisconcept is similar to control invariance. A simplified model of the ACAS Xa system was created,named VerticalCAS. DNNs were then generated to approximate the learned policy, and Reluplex wasused to verify whether the DNNs satisfied the safeability property. This work found thousands ofcounterexamples where the DNNs did not meet the criteria.Our approach for designing a safe predictor ensures any collision avoidance system will meet thesafeability property by construction. Appendix C describes in detail how we apply our approach toa subset of the VerticalCAS datasets using a conservative, convex approximation of the safeabilityconstraints. These constraints are defined such that if an aircraft state is in the ""unsafeable region"",thA i x ∈, for the advisory, the score for that advisory must not be the highest, i.e.,,iunsafeable thA ⇒ F (x) < max F (x) F (x) j, where is the output score for the advisory.,i i j j junsafeableTable 1 shows the performance of a standard, unconstrained network and our safe predictor. For bothnetworks, we present the percentage accuracy (ACC) and violations (percentage of inputs for whichthe network outputs an unsafe advisory). We train and test using PyTorch with two separate datasets,based on the previous advisory being Clear of Conflict (COC) and Climb at 1500 ft/min (CL1500).As shown in the table, our safe predictor adheres to the required safeability property. Furthermore,the accuracy of our predictor remains the same as the unconstrained network, demonstrating we arenot losing accuracy to achieve safety guarantees. 3βTable 1: Results of the best configurations of -TCVAE on DCI, FactorVAE, SAP, MIG, and IRSmetrics.NETWORK ACC (COC) VIOLATIONS (COC) ACC (CL1500) VIOLATIONS (CL1500)STANDARD 96.87 0.22 93.89 0.20SAFE 96.69 0.00 94.78 0.004 Discussion and Future WorkWe propose an approach for designing a safe predictor that adheres to input-output specifications foruse in safety-critical machine learning systems, demonstrating it on an aircraft collision avoidanceproblem.

The ""safeable region"" fora given advisory represents input locations where that advisory can be selected such that futureadvisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the advisory is ""unsafeable""and the corresponding input region is the ""unsafeable region"". Examples of these regions, and theirproximity functions are shown in Figure 5 for the CL1500 advisory.x ∈ A ⇒ F (x) < max F (x) ∀i AThe constraints we enforce are that , , where is,i i j j ,iunsafeable unsafeableth thi F (x) jthe unsafeable region for the advisory, and is the output score for the advisory.

We then compute aτ""distance function"" between input space points (vO - vI, h, ), and the unsafeable region for eachadvisory. These are not true distances but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeableset. These are then used to produce proximity functions as given in Equation 1.C.3 Structure of PredictorsThe compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hiddenlayers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for theunconstrained network. For our constrained predictors, we use the same structure but have sharedfirst four layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space,while allowing each predictor to adapt to its own constraints. After the shared layers, each constrainedpredictor has an additional two hidden layers and their final outputs are projected onto our convexG (x) = min G (x)approximation of the safe region of the output space, using . In our experiments,b j jϵ = 0.0001we set .With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeabilityconstraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and 2880,respectively. Our safe predictor is orders of magnitude smaller than the original look-up tables.C.4 Parameter OptimizationWe use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize boththe unconstrained and safe predictors using the asymmetric loss function to select advisories whilealso accurately predicting scores. The data is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seedof 0. The optimizer is ADAM with a learning rate of 0.0003 and batch size of 216, with training for500 epochs.Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 2.1Proof. x ∈ A σ (x) = 0 b ∈ O b = 0 w (x) = 0Let .

The“safeable region” for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can bechosen, for which future advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist forpreventing an NMAC, the advisory is deemed “unsafeable,” and the corresponding input region is the“unsafeable region.” Figure 5 shows an example of these regions for the CL1500 advisory.x ∈ A ⇒ F (x) < max F (x)The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: ,,i i j junsafeable∀i F (x) = min F (x). To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing , for alli j jx ∈ A .,iunsafeableC.2 Proximity FunctionsWe start by generating the bounds on the unsafeable regions. Then, a distance function is computedv − v τbetween points in the input space ( , h, ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. WhileO Ithese are not true distances, their values are 0 if and only if the data point is inside the unsafeable set.When used to produce proximity functions as given in Equation 1, these values help ensure safety.Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function, and proximity function for theCL1500 advisory.C.3 Structure of PredictorsThe compressed versions of the policy tables from prior work are neural networks with six hiddenlayers, 45 dimensions in each layer, and ReLU activation functions. We use the same architecturefor our standard, unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture.However, the first four hidden layers are shared between all of the predictors. This learns a single,shared input space representation, and also allows each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Eachconstrained predictor has two additional hidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convexapproximation of the safe output region. We accomplish this by setting the score for any unsafeablei G (x) = min G (x) − ϵ ϵ = 0.0001advisory to . In our experiments, we used .i j jTo enforce the VerticalCAS safeability constraints, we need 30 separate predictors.

However, our safe predictor remains smaller than the original look-up tables by severalorders of magnitude.C.4 Parameter OptimizationWe define our networks and perform parameter optimization using PyTorch. We optimize theparameters of both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric lossfunction, guiding the network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores fromthe look-up tables.

R013,"Generalization in ReLU Networks via RestrictedIsometry and Norm ConcentrationAbstractRegression tasks, while aiming to model relationships across the entire input space,are often constrained by limited training data. Nevertheless, if the hypothesis func-tions can be represented effectively by the data, there is potential for identifying amodel that generalizes well. This paper introduces the Neural Restricted IsometryProperty (NeuRIPs), which acts as a uniform concentration event that ensures allshallow ReLU networks are sketched with comparable quality. To determine thesample complexity necessary to achieve NeuRIPs, we bound the covering numbersof the networks using the Sub-Gaussian metric and apply chaining techniques. As-suming the NeuRIPs event, we then provide bounds on the expected risk, applicableto networks within any sublevel set of the empirical risk. Our results show that allnetworks with sufficiently small empirical risk achieve uniform generalization.1 IntroductionA fundamental requirement of any scientific model is a clear evaluation of its limitations. In recentyears, supervised machine learning has seen the development of tools for automated model discoveryfrom training data. However, these methods often lack a robust theoretical framework to estimatemodel limitations. Statistical learning theory quantifies the limitation of a trained model by thegeneralization error. This theory uses concepts such as the VC-dimension and Rademacher complexityto analyze generalization error bounds for classification problems. While these traditional complexitynotions have been successful in classification problems, they do not apply to generic regressionproblems with unbounded risk functions, which are the focus of this study. Moreover, traditionaltools in statistical learning theory have not been able to provide a fully satisfying generalizationtheory for neural networks.Understanding the risk surface during neural network training is crucial for establishing a strongtheoretical foundation for neural network-based machine learning, particularly for understandinggeneralization. Recent studies on neural networks suggest intriguing properties of the risk surface.In large networks, local minima of the risk form a small bond at the global minimum. Surprisingly,global minima exist in each connected component of the risk’s sublevel set and are path-connected.In this work, we contribute to a generalization theory for shallow ReLU networks, by giving uniformgeneralization error bounds within the empirical risk’s sublevel set. We use methods from the analysisof convex linear regression, where generalization bounds for empirical risk minimizers are derivedfrom recent advancements in stochastic processes’ chaining theory. Empirical risk minimizationfor non-convex hypothesis functions cannot generally be solved efficiently. However, under certainassumptions, it is still possible to derive generalization error bounds, as we demonstrate in this paperfor shallow ReLU networks. Existing works have applied methods from compressed sensing tobound generalization errors for arbitrary hypothesis functions. However, they do not capture therisk’s stochastic nature through the more advanced chaining theory.This paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section II by outlining our assumptions about theparameters of shallow ReLU networks and the data distribution to be interpolated. The expected andempirical risk are introduced in Section III, where we define the Neural Restricted Isometry Property.(NeuRIPs) as a uniform norm concentration event. We present a bound on the sample complexity forachieving NeuRIPs in Theorem 1, which depends on both the network architecture and parameterassumptions. We provide upper bounds on the generalization error that are uniformly applicableacross the sublevel sets of the empirical risk in Section IV. We prove this property in a networkrecovery setting in Theorem 2, and also an agnostic learning setting in Theorem 3. These resultsensure a small generalization error, when any optimization algorithm finds a network with a smallempirical risk. We develop the key proof techniques for deriving the sample complexity of achievingNeuRIPs in Section V, by using the chaining theory of stochastic processes. The derived results aresummarized in Section VI, where we also explore potential future research directions.2 Notation and AssumptionsIn this section, we will define the key notations and assumptions for the neural networks examinedR Rϕ : → ϕ(x) := max(x, 0)in this study.

Typically they are representednby a graph with neurons in a single hidden layer.

However, in the chosen stochastic setting, we cannot assume that the termination of anoptimization and the norm concentration at that network are independent events. We overcome thisby not specifying the outcome of an optimization method and instead stating uniform bounds onthe norm concentration. The only assumption on an algorithm is therefore the identification of a¯ϵ Rnetwork that permits an upper bound on its empirical risk. The event NeuRIPs( ) then restricts thettexpected risk to be below the corresponding level . µWe now discuss the empirical risk surface for generic distributions that satisfy Assumption 2, wherey does not necessarily have to be a neural network. ¯C C C C C C PTheorem 3.

We defined the Neural Restricted Isometry Property(NeuRIPs) and determined the sample complexity required to achieve NeuRIPs, which depends onrealistic parameter bounds and the network architecture. We applied our findings to derive upperbounds on the expected risk, which are valid uniformly across sublevel sets of the empirical risk.If a network optimization algorithm can identify a network with a small empirical risk, our resultsguarantee that this network will generalize well. By deriving uniform concentration statements, wehave resolved the problem of independence between the termination of an optimization algorithm ata certain network and the empirical risk concentration at that network. Future studies may focus onperforming uniform empirical norm concentration on the critical points of the empirical risk, whichcould lead to even tighter bounds for the sample complexity.We also plan to apply our methods to input distributions more general than the Gaussian distribution.If generic Gaussian distributions can be handled, one could then derive bounds for the Sub-Gaussiancovering number for deep ReLU networks by induction across layers. We also expect that ourresults on the covering numbers could be extended to more generic Lipschitz continuous activationfunctions other than ReLU. This proposition is based on the concentration of measure phenomenon,which provides bounds on the Sub-Gaussian norm of functions on normal concentrating input spaces.ϵBecause these bounds scale with the Lipschitz constant of the function, they can be used to find -netsfor neurons that have identical activation patterns.Broader ImpactSupervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization iscritical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeperunderstanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data.We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentrationevents for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms.7",1,NeurIPS
R014,"Addressing Min-Max Challenges in Nonconvex-Nonconcave Problemswith Solutions Exhibiting Weak Minty PropertiesAbstractThis research examines a specific category of structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems that demon-strate a characteristic known as weak Minty solutions. This concept, which has only recently been defined, hasalready demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time.We establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method (OGDA) withinthis framework, achieving a convergence rate of 1/k for the most effective iteration, measured by the squaredoperator norm, a result that aligns with the extragradient method (EG). Furthermore, we introduce a modifiedversion of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem’sspecific parameters.1 IntroductionThe recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,have generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,adversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developedthat generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimizationcomponent and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability incertain cases.A specific subset of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was analyzed, and it was found that the extragradient method (EG)exhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings. Surprisingly, these problems did not appear to possess any ofthe recognized favorable characteristics, such as monotonicity or Minty solutions. Subsequently, a suitable concept was identified(see Assumption 1), which is less restrictive than the presence of a Minty solution (a condition frequently employed in the existingliterature) and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity. Because of these properties that unify and generalize, the concept ofweak Minty solutions was quickly investigated. R R Rd d ∗ dF : → u ∈ ρ > 0Assumption 1 (Weak Minty solution). For a given operator , there is a point and a parameter such that:ρ R∗ 2 d⟨F (u), u − u ⟩ ≥ − ∥F (u)∥ ∀u ∈ . (1)2Moreover, it has been demonstrated that a modified version of EG is capable of addressing problems with such solutions, achieving−1O(ϵ )a complexity of for the squared operator norm. This adaptation, referred to as EG+, is based on a bold extrapolation stepfollowed by a cautious update step. A similar step size approach has been previously examined in the context of a stochastic variantof EG.In a similar vein, we explore a variation of the optimistic gradient descent ascent (OGDA), also known as Forward-Reflected-Backward (FoRB). We address the following question with an affirmative answer:Can OGDA achieve convergence guarantees comparable to those of EG when dealing with weak Minty solutions?a > 0 0 < γ ≤ 1Specifically, we demonstrate that a modified version of the OGDA method, defined for a step size and a parameteras follows: u = u¯ − aF (u¯ ),k k ku¯ = u¯ − γaF (u ), ∀k ≥ 0,k+1 k kcan achieve the same convergence bounds as EG+ by requiring only a single gradient oracle call in each iteration.γ = 1It is worth noting that OGDA is most frequently expressed in a form where . However, two recent studies have examinedγa more generalized coefficient. While these earlier studies focused on the monotone setting, the true significance of becomesγapparent only when dealing with weak Minty solutions. In this context, we find that must be greater than 1 to ensure convergence,a phenomenon that is not observed in monotone problems.When examining a general smooth min-max problem: min max f (x, y)x yF F (u) := [∇ f (x, y), −∇ f (x, y)] u = (x, y)the operator mentioned in Assumption 1 naturally emerges as with . However,x y Fby examining saddle point problems from the broader viewpoint of variational inequalities (VIs) through the operator , we canconcurrently address more scenarios, such as certain equilibrium problems.ρThe parameter in the definition of weak Minty solutions (1) is crucial for both the analysis and the experiments. Specifically, itρis essential that the step size exceeds a value proportional to . Simultaneously, as is typical, the step size is limited from above1Fby the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of . For instance, since some researchers require the step size to be less than , their4L1 1 1ρ < ρ < γ = 1 ρ <convergence claim is valid only if . This condition was later improved to for the choice and to for4L 2L Lγeven smaller values of . As in the monotone setting, OGDA requires a smaller step size than EG. Nevertheless, through a different1ρ < γ aanalysis, we are able to match the most general condition on the weak Minty parameter for appropriate and .L1.1 ContributionOur contributions are summarized as follows: O(1/k)1. We establish a new convergence rate of , measured by the squared operator norm, for a modified version of OGDA,which we call OGDA+. This rate matches that of EG and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions tothe Minty variational inequality.2. Even when a stronger condition is imposed, specifically that the operator is also monotone, we enhance the range of feasibleγ = 1step sizes for OGDA+ and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method ( ).−2O(ϵ )3. We demonstrate a complexity bound of for a stochastic variant of the OGDA+ method.4. We also introduce an adaptive step size version of EG+. This version achieves the same convergence guarantees withoutFrequiring any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the operator . Consequently, it can potentially take larger steps inareas with low curvature, enabling convergence where a fixed step size strategy might fail.1.2 Related literatureWe will concentrate on the nonconvex-nonconcave setting, as there is a substantial body of work on convergence rates in terms of a gapfunction or distance to a solution for monotone problems, as well as generalizations such as nonconvex-concave, convex-nonconcave,or under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz assumption.Weak Minty. It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,termed ""weak Minty,"" without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.Convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large asthe update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing thelength of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search isalso proposed, which may incur extra gradient computations or require second-order information (in contrast to the adaptive stepsize we propose in Algorithm 3). A different approach is taken by focusing on the min-max setting and using multiple ascent stepsO(1/k)per descent step, achieving the same rate as EG.Minty solutions. Numerous studies have presented various methods for scenarios where the problem at hand has a Minty solution.It was shown that weakly monotone VIs can be solved by iteratively adding a quadratic proximity term and repeatedly optimizingthe resulting strongly monotone VI using any convergent method. The convergence of the OGDA method was proven, but without aspecific rate. It was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm (GRAAL) is valid without any changes. Whilethe assumption that a Minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting, it is challenging to find non-monotoneproblems that possess such solutions. In our setting, as per Assumption 1, the Minty inequality (MVI) can be violated at any pointby a factor proportional to the squared operator norm.Negative comonotonicity. Although previously studied under the term ""cohypomonotonicity,"" the concept of negative comono-tonicity has recently been explored. It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Mintysolutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and2O(1/k )an improved convergence rate of (in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version ofthe reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Mintysolutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Mintysolution). Another intriguing observation was made, where for cohypomonotone problems, a monotonically decreasing gradientnorm was demonstrated when using EG. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, emphasizing the need to differentiatethis class from problems with weak Minty solutions. 2αInteraction dominance. The concept of -interaction dominance for nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was investigated,yand it was shown that the proximal-point method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in and linearly if it is met in bothcomponents. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components, it is also negativelycomonotone.Optimism. The positive effects of introducing the simple modification commonly known as optimism have recently attracted theattention of the machine learning community. Its name comes from online optimization. The idea dates back even further and hasalso been studied in the mathematical programming community.2 Preliminaries2.1 Notions of solutionWe outline the most frequently used solution concepts in the context of variational inequalities (VIs) and related areas. TheseR R Rd d dC ⊆ F : →concepts are typically defined with respect to a constraint set . A Stampacchia solution of the VI given by is a∗upoint such that: ∗ ∗⟨F (u ), u − u ⟩ ≥ 0 ∀u ∈ C. (SVI)Rd ∗C = F (u ) = 0In this work, we only consider the unconstrained case where , and the above condition simplifies to . Closely∗u ∈ Crelated is the following concept: A Minty solution is a point such that:∗⟨F (u), u − u ⟩ ≥ 0 ∀u ∈ C. (MVI)FFor a continuous operator , a Minty solution of the VI is always a Stampacchia solution. The converse is generally not true butFholds, for example, if the operator is monotone. Specifically, there are nonmonotone problems with Stampacchia solutions butwithout any Minty solutions.2.2 Notions of monotonicityThis section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them.FAn operator is considered monotone if: ⟨F (u) − F (v), u − v⟩ ≥ 0.Such operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions, from convex-concave min-max problems, or from equilibriumproblems.Two frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators, which satisfy:2⟨F (u) − F (v), u − v⟩ ≥ µ∥u − v∥ ,and cocoercive operators, which fulfill: 2⟨F (u) − F (v), u − v⟩ ≥ β∥F (u) − F (v)∥ . (2)Strongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in strongly-convex-strongly-concave min-maxβproblems. Cocoercive operators appear, for instance, as gradients of smooth convex functions, in which case (2) holds with equalto the inverse of the gradient’s Lipschitz constant.Departing from monotonicity. Both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploringthe non-monotone domain. Given that general non-monotone operators may display erratic behavior, such as periodic cycles andspurious attractors, it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable. First andνforemost is the extensively studied setting of -weak monotonicity: 2⟨F (u) − F (v), u − v⟩ ≥ −ν∥u − v∥ .Such operators arise as the gradients of the well-studied class of weakly convex functions, a rather general class of functions as itincludes all functions without upward cusps. In particular, every smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill thisproperty. On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,has received much less attention and is given by: 2⟨F (u) − F (v), u − v⟩ ≥ −γ∥F (u) − F (v)∥ .Clearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.Behavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficientto require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead ofFmonotonicity, it is enough to ask for the operator to be star-monotone, i.e.,∗⟨F (u), u − u ⟩ ≥ 0,or star-cocoercive, ∗ 2⟨F (u), u − u ⟩ ≥ γ∥F (u)∥ .In this spirit, we can provide a new interpretation to the assumption of the existence of a weak Minty solution as asking for theFoperator to be negatively star-cocoercive (with respect to at least one solution). Furthermore, we want to point out that while the∗uabove star notions are sometimes required to hold for all solutions , in the following we only require it to hold for a single solution.33 OGDA for problems with weak Minty solutions γThe generalized version of OGDA, which we denote with a ""+"" to emphasize the presence of the additional parameter , is given by:Algorithm 1 OGDA+Rdu = u ∈ a > 0 0 < γ < 1Require: Starting point , step size and parameter .0 −1 k = 0, 1, ...for dou = u − a((1 + γ)F (u ) − F (u ))k+1 k k k−1end forR R 1d dF : → L > ρ (u )Theorem 3.1.

To be able to choose a large step size , we must decrease , as evident from (3). However, this degrades the algorithm’sspeed by making the update steps smaller. The same effect can be observed for EG+ and is therefore not surprising. One couldγderive an optimal (i.e., minimizing the right-hand side) from Theorem 3.1, but this results in a non-intuitive cubic dependence onρ γ. In practice, the strategy of decreasing until convergence is achieved, but not further, yields reasonable results.1ρ <Furthermore, we want to point out that the condition is precisely the best possible bound for EG+.L3.1 Improved bounds under monotonicity FWhile the above theorem also holds if the operator is monotone, we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence onthe parameters: 2−γR Rd d − ϵF : → L aL = ϵ > 0Theorem 3.2.

In theweak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately,γthe current analysis does not allow for variable .4 EG+ with adaptive step sizesIn this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of theLLipschitz constant , as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead tosmall step sizes and slow convergence behavior. However, in the presence of weak Minty solutions, there is additional interest inchoosing large step sizes. We observed in Theorem 3.1 and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that theρstep size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak Minty parameter to guarantee convergence at all. For these reasons, we wantto outline a method using adaptive step sizes, meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no line-search is carriedout.Since the analysis of OGDA+ is already quite involved in the constant step size regime, we choose to equip EG+ with an adaptivestep size which estimates the inverse of the (local) Lipschitz constant, see (4). Due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods,especially in the context of VIs, is so vast, we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especiallyinteresting properties. In particular, we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure, which typically result inmultiple gradient computations per iteration.We use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local Lipschitz constant and forces a monotonedecreasing behavior. Such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone VIs and similarly in the context of the mirror-proxmethod, which corresponds to EG in the setting of (non-Euclidean) Bregman distances.A version of EG with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated, with the unique feature that it is able to achieve theoptimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification. However, these rates are only for monotone VIs andare in terms of the gap function.One of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing, whichresults in poor behavior if a high-curvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a low-curvature region. To the best of ourknowledge, the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat VIs and does not use a possibly costly linesearchFis the golden ratio algorithm. It comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the Lipschitz constant of atall. While it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a quantitativeconvergence result is still open.

The main advantage resides in the fact that theFLipschitz constant of the operator does not need to be known. Moreover, the step size choice presented in (4) might allow usto take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global Lipschitz constant if the iterates never, or only during laterLiterations, visit the region of high curvature (large local ). In such cases, these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage1ρ < ρ < a /2that they allow us to solve a richer class of problems, as we are able to relax the condition in the case of EG+ to ,∞4La = lim a ≥ τ /Lwhere .∞ k kOn the other hand, we face the problem that the bounds in Theorem 4.1 only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when1a /a ≤ is finally satisfied. In theory, this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than ink k+1 τthe starting area, as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process, resulting in the quotienta /a τbeing too large. This drawback could be mitigated by choosing smaller. However, this will result in poor performancek k+1due to small step sizes. Even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed, this problem could not becircumvented, and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate.5 Numerical experimentsIn the following, we compare the EG+ method with the two methods we propose: OGDA+ and EG+ with adaptive step size (seeAlgorithm 1 and Algorithm 3, respectively). Last but not least, we also include the CurvatureEG+ method, which is a modificationof EG+ that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps. In addition, a backtracking linesearch is performed withan initial guess made by second-order information, whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments.5.1 Von Neumann’s ratio gameWe consider von Neumann’s ratio game, which is given by: ⟨x, Ry⟩V (x, y) =max ,min (5)⟨x, Sy⟩y∈∆x∈∆ nm (cid:80)dR R Rm×n m×n dR ∈ S ∈ ⟨x, Sy⟩ > 0 x ∈ ∆ , y ∈ ∆ ∆ := {z ∈ : z > 0, z = 1}where and with for all , with denotingm n i ii=1V (x, y)the unit simplex. Expression (5) can be interpreted as the value for a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies.We see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of (5). Interestingly, we still observe good convergence behavior, althoughρan estimated is more than ten times larger than the estimated Lipschitz constant.5.2 ForsakenA particularly difficult min-max toy example with a ""Forsaken"" solution was proposed and is given by:min max x(y − 0.45) + ϕ(x) − ϕ(y), (6)R Rx∈ y∈1 2 1 16 4 2 ∗ ∗ϕ(z) = z − z + z − z (x , y ) ≈ (0.08, 0.4)where . This problem exhibits a Stampacchia solution at , but also two limit6 4 4 2cycles not containing any critical point of the objective function. In addition, it was also observed that the limit cycle closer tothe solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus ""shielding"" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box1∥(x, y)∥ < 3 ρ ≥ 2 · 0.477761 ≈ 0.08, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with , which is much larger than . In line∞ 2L1with these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by converge. In light of thisLobservation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitzconstant. Similarly, our proposed adaptive step size version of EG+ (see Algorithm 3) is also able to break through the repellinglimit cycle and converge to the solution. On top of this, it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations inthe backtracking procedure.5.3 Lower bound example ρ LThe following min-max problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between and for EG+:ζ 2 2min max µxy + (x − y ). (7)2R Rx∈ y∈ 1γ a = (0, 0)In particular, it was stated that EG+ (with any ) and constant step size converges for this problem if and only if is aL1−γρ < ρ Lweak Minty solution with , where and can be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by:L 2 2µ − ζ(cid:112) 2 2L = µ + ζ ρ = .and 2µ1µ = 3 ζ = −1 ρ = γBy choosing and , we get exactly , therefore predicting divergence of EG+ for any , which is exactly what isL 1ρ <empirically observed. Although the general upper bound proved in Theorem 3.1 only states convergence in the case , weLobserve rapid convergence of OGDA+ for this example, showcasing that it can drastically outperform EG+ in some scenarios.66 ConclusionMany intriguing questions persist in the domain of min-max problems, particularly when departing from the convex-concaveO(1/k)framework. Very recently, it was demonstrated that the bounds on the squared operator norm for EG and OGDA for thelast iterate (and not just the best one) are valid even in the negatively comonotone setting. Deriving a comparable statement in thepresence of merely weak Minty solutions remains an open question.In general, our analysis and experiments seem to suggest that there is minimal benefit in employing OGDA+ over EG+ for themajority of problems, as the reduced iteration cost is counterbalanced by the smaller step size. An exception is presented by problem(7), which is not covered by theory, and OGDA+ is the only method capable of converging.Finally, we note that the previous paradigm in pure minimization of ""smaller step size ensures convergence"" but ""larger step sizegets there faster,"" where the latter is typically constrained by the reciprocal of the gradient’s Lipschitz constant, does not appearto hold true for min-max problems anymore. The analysis of various methods in the presence of weak Minty solutions indicates1that convergence can be lost if the step size is excessively small and sometimes needs to be larger than , which one can typicallyLonly hope for in adaptive methods. Our EG+ method with adaptive step size accomplishes this even without the added expense of abacktracking linesearch.article graphicx 7",1,TMLR
R015,"Examining the Convergence of Denoising Diffusion ProbabilisticModels: A Quantitative AnalysisAbstractDeep generative models, particularly diffusion models, are a significant family within deep learning. This studyprovides a precise upper limit for the Wasserstein distance between a learned distribution by a diffusion modeland the target distribution. In contrast to earlier research, this analysis does not rely on presumptions regardingthe learned score function. Furthermore, the findings are applicable to any data-generating distributions withinrestricted instance spaces, even those lacking a density relative to the Lebesgue measure, and the upper limit is notexponentially dependent on the ambient space dimension. The primary finding expands upon recent research byMbacke et al. (2023), and the proofs presented are fundamental.1 IntroductionDiffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (VAEs), are among the most influentialfamilies of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,as well as in various other applications.Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generativemodels (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, whilesimultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples. Conversely, SGMsemploy score-matching methods to approximate the score function of the data-generating distribution, subsequently generating newsamples through Langevin dynamics. Recognizing that real-world distributions might lack a defined score function, adding varyingnoise levels to training samples to encompass the entire instance space and training a neural network to concurrently learn the scorefunction for all noise levels has been proposed.Although DDPMs and SGMs may initially seem distinct, it has been demonstrated that DDPMs implicitly approximate the scorefunction, with the sampling process resembling Langevin dynamics. Moreover, a unified perspective of both methods using stochasticdifferential equations (SDEs) has been derived. The SGM can be viewed as a discretization of Brownian motion, and the DDPM as adiscretization of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Consequently, both DDPMs and SGMs are commonly referred to as SGMs in theliterature. This explains why prior research investigating the theoretical aspects of diffusion models has adopted the score-basedframework, necessitating assumptions about the effectiveness of the learned score function.In this research, a different strategy is employed, applying methods created for VAEs to DDPMs, which can be viewed as hierarchicalVAEs with fixed encoders. This method enables the derivation of quantitative, Wasserstein-based upper bounds without makingassumptions about the data distribution or the learned score function, and with simple proofs that do not need the SDE toolkit.Furthermore, the bounds presented here do not involve any complex discretization steps, as the forward and backward processes areconsidered discrete-time from the beginning, rather than being viewed as discretizations of continuous-time processes.1.1 Related WorksThere has been an increasing amount of research aimed at providing theoretical findings on the convergence of SGMs. However,these studies frequently depend on restrictive assumptions regarding the data-generating distribution, produce non-quantitative upperbounds, or exhibit exponential dependencies on certain parameters. This work successfully circumvents all three of these limitations.Some bounds are based on very restrictive assumptions about the data-generating distribution, such as log-Sobolev inequalities,which are unrealistic for real-world data distributions. Furthermore, some studies establish upper bounds on the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence or the total variation (TV) distance between the data-generating distribution and the distribution learned by thediffusion model; however, unless strong assumptions are made about the support of the data-generating distribution, KL and TVreach their maximum values. Such assumptions arguably do not hold for real-world data-generating distributions, which are widelybelieved to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Other work establishes conditions under which the support of the input distributionis equal to the support of the learned distribution, and generalizes the bound to all f-divergences. Assuming L2 accurate scoreestimation, some establish Wasserstein distance upper bounds under weaker assumptions on the data-generating distribution, buttheir Wasserstein-based bounds are not quantitative. Quantitative Wasserstein distance upper bounds under the manifold hypothesishave been derived, but these bounds exhibit exponential dependencies on some of the problem parameters.1.2 Our contributionsIn this study, strong assumptions about the data-generating distribution are avoided, and a quantitative upper bound on the Wassersteindistance is established without exponential dependencies on problem parameters, including the ambient space dimension. Moreover,a common aspect of the aforementioned studies is that their bounds are contingent on the error of the score estimator. According tosome, providing precise guarantees for the estimation of the score function is challenging, as it necessitates an understanding of thenon-convex training dynamics of neural network optimization, which is currently beyond reach. Therefore, upper bounds are derivedwithout making assumptions about the learned score function. Instead, the bound presented here is dependent on a reconstructionloss calculated over a finite independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample. Intuitively, a loss function is defined, whichquantifies the average Euclidean distance between a sample from the data-generating distribution and the reconstruction obtained by˘sampling noise and passing it through the backward process (parameterized by 03b8). This method is inspired by previous work onVAEs.This approach offers numerous benefits: it does not impose restrictive assumptions on the data-generating distribution, avoidsexponential dependencies on the dimension, and provides a quantitative upper bound based on the Wasserstein distance. Furthermore,this method benefits from utilizing very straightforward and basic proofs.2 PreliminariesThroughout this paper, lowercase letters are used to represent both probability measures and their densities with respect to theq(x |x )Lebesgue measure, and variables are added in parentheses to enhance readability (e.g., to denote a time-dependentt t−1DX Rconditional distribution).

The product measure is referred to as the trivial coupling, and the Wasserstein distance of order 1 is simply referred toas the Wasserstein distance.2.1 Denoising Diffusion ModelsInstead of employing the SDE framework, diffusion models are presented using the DDPM formulation with discrete-time processes.A diffusion model consists of two discrete-time stochastic processes: a forward process and a backward process. Both processes are0 ≤ t ≤ T Tindexed by time , where the number of time steps is a predetermined choice.x ∼ µ q(x |x )**The forward process.** The forward process transforms a data point into a noise distribution through a sequence0 T 0q(x |x ) 1 ≤ t ≤ Tof conditional distributions for . It is assumed that the forward process is defined such that for sufficientlyt t−1T q(x |x ) p(x )large , the distribution is close to a simple noise distribution , which is referred to as the prior distribution. ForT 0 Tp(x ) = N (x ; 0, I)instance, , the standard multivariate normal distribution, has been chosen in previous work.T T**The backward process.** The backward process is a Markov process with parametric transition kernels. The objective of thebackward process is to perform the reverse operation of the forward process: transforming noise samples into (approximate) samplesµfrom the distribution . Following previous work, it is assumed that the backward process is defined by Gaussian distributionsp (x |x ) 2 ≤ t ≤ Tfor asθ t−1 t θ 2p (x |x ) = N (x ; g (x ), σ I),θ t−1 t t−1 tt tand θp (x |x ) = g (x ),θ 0 1 112 θ D Dσ ∈ R g : R → Rwhere the variance parameters are defined by a fixed schedule, the mean functions are learned using a≥0t tθ Dθ 2 ≤ t ≤ T g : R → X σneural network (with parameters ) for , and is a separate function dependent on .

This assumption is discussed in Remark 3.2.t t2.2 Additional Definitionsπ (·|x )The distribution is defined asθ 0 π (·|x ) = q(x |x )p (x |x )p (x |x ) . . . p (x |x )p (·|x ).θ 0 T 0 θ T −1 T θ T −2 T −1 θ 1 2 θ 1x ∈ X π (·|x ) X q(x |x )Intuitively, for each , represents the distribution on obtained by reconstructing samples from through0 θ 0 T 0f : X → Rthe backward process.

Since the triangle inequality implies1 θ θ θW (µ, π (·)) ≤ W (µ, µ ) + W (µ , π (·)),1 θ 1 1 θn nW (µ, π (·))the distance can be upper-bounded by upper-bounding the two expressions on the right-hand side separately. The1 θ θ θW (µ, µ ) W (µ, µ )upper bound on is obtained using a straightforward adaptation of a proof. First, is upper-bounded using the1 1n nlexpectation of the loss function , then the resulting expression is upper-bounded using a PAC-Bayesian-style expression dependentθon the empirical risk and the prior-matching term.θ θ iW (µ , π (·)) µ π (·|x ) π (·)The upper bound on the second term uses the definition of .
